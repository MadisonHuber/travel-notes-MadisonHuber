                Hi! I'm Maddie, a sophomore computer science student at UNC Chapel Hill. I'm studying abroad in
                Copenhagen
                this summer and did some traveling beforehand. You can use this blog to read up about my trip and learn
                about what I've been up to!
            </p>

                I love computer science because there are endless opportunities to explore and learn new things. Itâ€™s full of possibilities, but the programmer takes it and turns it into something expressive and powerful. The challenge of thinking about things in new ways is one of the aspects of computer science that fascinates me most and keeps me curious. I love that programming lets me start with what I know and build something completely new and unique from it.
            </p>

                Aside from programming, my other interests primarily include music, accidentally discovering new things, and dogs. I'm from Huntersville, NC but way back in the day 'home' was up in Washington state.

                In case you were curious, my favorite programming keyword is currently boolean in TypeScript and other languages. I like it because you can make a boolean as complicated as you want, but in the end it always boils down to just true or false. I'll always like it, but I've learned so much in the past two years that I'll need to give it some more thought now.
