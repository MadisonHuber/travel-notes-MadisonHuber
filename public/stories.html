            <h3 id="10">Walking the Wall</h3>
            <p class="info">
                Today of course began with some 426 prep, but after working for a while we headed to see the Berlin Wall. We followed a path along the wall and took in all the murals painted along it as part of the East Side Gallery. We also went to a nice cafe for some fancy Baumkuchen chocolate cake which was quite delicious. After this we headed back to the train station to wait for our night bus to Copenhagen.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                The fancy train station had a McDonald's with German food they don't have in America so that was interesting, and they also had an Ampelmann store! The Ampelmann is the cute little green man in the walk symbol for pedestrians throughout streets in Berlin. It has also expanded into quite a brand, selling everything from bath robes to pasta.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                Eventually we got on the bus around 10:30, and it was nice aside from a fly infestation and WiFi that didn't work. This took us to a ferry around 5:00 am, and we eventually made it to Copenhagen a little before 8:00 am. I slept some on the ride so hopefully that'll help with getting on track with a better sleep schedule in time for the start of class.
            </p>

            <h3 id="9">The Berlin Bears</h3>
            <p class="info">
                The day started as they have been recently, with me working on 426. Later on Selina came to Berlin and we made our way through the city, stopping in notable place like Alexanderplatz and the Brandenburg Gate. As we walked through the city we noticed a bunch of bear statues everywhere. As it turns out, these bears are Buddy Bears, which have been the symbol of Berlin since the early 2000s. The bear is part of Berlin's coat of arms, and these bears specifically are meant to promote unity, kindness, tolerance, optimism, and other positive sentiments.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                I also tried currywurst today, which was basically a fancy hot dog with really thick ketchup and curry. It was a little spicy but not too much, and overall I'd say it was pretty good. We got a little lost coming back when the metro line we needed wasn't running but we eventually made it.
            </p>

            <h3 id="8">The Definition of Last-Minute</h3>
            <p class="info">
                This morning when I woke up, I knew I was checking out of my hotel, but I didn't know a thing beyond
                that. Before I started to pack I decided I'd head to Berlin, Germany. It was a step closer to Copenhagen
                so why not. So I was able to book a ticket for a train to get there, but that's about it. I checked out
                fine then hurried off to the train station so I wouldn't miss the train. The tricky thing about taking
                the train from Prague is that they don't have platform numbers listed on your ticket, so you must go and
                watch the screens, waiting for them to update with departing trains, times, and platforms. This
                information is only displayed in full around 20 minutes prior to departure, so you've got to make sure
                you know where things are so you can get to whichever platform you need to be at in time.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                The train was quite crowded this time, but the ride was scenic as usual. About halfway through the train
                ride was when I spent more time trying to figure out my plans. I knew I still didn't have a place to
                stay in Berlin, so I figured I'd start with that since I was already on my way there. I did find
                somewhere so there's no need to worry.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                The Berlin train station was huge. It was bigger than any other I had been to, with somewhere around 5
                stories. There were about as many restaurants and shops as one would find in a decent sized shopping
                mall. The cool part was standing in the middle, watching trains go by above you and below you at the
                same time.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                From there I got settled into the new city, went for a walk in a nearby park, and ended the day by doing
                some work for 426. Although I'm not in Copenhagen yet, today was the last day of my solo traveling. I
                still have one or two days in Germany before I leave for Denmark. I'm not quite sure if it'll be one or
                two as I haven't planned that far ahead, but we'll see.
            </p>

            <h3 id="7">Let's Go to the Mall</h3>
            <p class="info">
                I am writing to inform you that everything is fine now - but what a long 24 hours it's been! After
                finally settling in last night I decided to try to tackle some more GRQs. The problem, however, was that
                my computer and charger decided to team up against me and make it impossible to charge my computer. I'm
                not sure why they did this but I certainly didn't appreciate it. This has happened to me once before,
                but I tried everything I could then to fix it, let it rest, and came back the next morning to a happily
                charging computer. So, I figured I should again try everything I could think of or find to try to fix it
                as I wasn't fired up about the idea of facing the death of my computer with no apparent means for
                revival. So I did all the same things as last time, the nervousness increasing as each attempt failed
                and as the battery slowly ticked lower and lower, making its way all the way to 0%. Tensions were high
                now, but I could feel my time and hope slipping away the whole time, so although I wasn't surprised when
                it finally reached 0% as I had known it was coming, there was still the realization that as much as I
                hated leaving it in such a state, I could do nothing more right then and would have to wait until the
                next day to try something new.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                So, when I woke up and eventually got over my bad mood enough to do something about the problem I headed
                to some tech support store as Prague does not have an Apple store. They told me there was an I/O issue
                in my computer itself and that my charger was broken, so lots of good news. I told them no thank you
                when they asked to keep it for 2-3 days to fix it, and tried to just get a new charger but unfortunately
                they happened to be out of stock. So the closest place I found that sold one was a mall, which was quite
                fancy and had a KFC and a McDonald's in its food court.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                The new charger seems to be working fine now, so
                after I got it I headed into Old Town to check it out and go exploring. I did see some cool sights, and
                was able to get a glimpse of the Astronomical Clock at the top of the hour. I also tried a Trdeln√≠k, which was some sort of cone made of sweet dough filled with whipped cream and strawberries.
            </p>

            <h3 id="6">From Munich to Music</h3>
            <p class="info">
                The train ride from Munich to Prague was nice as usual, though this time the scenery consisted of more
                forests, lakes, and large rock forms. The developed land we passed once crossing into the Czech Repulic
                was more run-down than what I had seen in Germany and Austria. Once we arrived, I walked around the
                train station for a bit. It was large and ornate in some areas with enough shops to constitute a
                shopping mall. My favorite feature of the train station was the piano sitting in the center. Anyone who
                walked by would slow down as they passed in front of it, with expressions on their faces reflecting the
                internal debate of whether to spare a minute to play in the crowded space or to continue on their way.
                The first person I saw to play was a young child. Despite her age she was focused and played well, even
                with her dad standing over her shoulder. Her playing so calmly in the crowded station must have helped
                others realize their own bravery; once she finished, other travelers took turns playing a song or two
                before letting someone else have a chance. This formed an ongoing stream of music, sometimes faint and
                timid but sometimes with enough force such that the escaping sound drowned out the announcements on the
                speaker. A school group even passed through with each student taking a few minutes to play.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                It had been months since I last heard a piano, and even longer (if ever) since I had heard full sonatas
                and concertos, especially coming effortlessly from the fingers of young children. The other thing this
                demonstrated was just how many people could easily sit down on the spot and play beautiful songs from
                memory without messing up a note all the while acting like it was nothing. What happened next was quite
                surprising, and I'm not sure what brought it on, but a few moments after the stream of secret musicians
                ended, I found myslef walking to the little round stool that sat facing the keys. Before I knew it I had
                started to play what little I remember, and almost immediately after beginning a feeling of excitement
                and freedom struck me. And when it did, I realized just how long it had been since I experienced such a
                thrill. Once so afraid (and maybe in normal circumstances still so afraid), I was sitting there letting
                the muscle memory carry me through the song as my heart raced. As I have forgotten most of what I
                learned as a child, I wasn't playing for long, but I won't soon forget the excitement that came along
                with sitting there realizing what I was doing.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                Despite some complications leaving the station and settling in at where I was staying, I'd still
                classify this as a pretty great day. I did something that completely surprised me, and managed to make
                it through without getting nervous or freaking out even after it hit me what I was doing. It certainly
                wasn't planned (which isn't surprising given how little planning I ever do), but I'm glad it happened,
                even if I'm still not quite sure how I did it.
            </p>

            <h3 id="5">Snow in Salzburg</h3>
            <p class="info">
                Not getting on a normal sleep schedule has been a little annoying and very tiring, but it also means
                another day of not being late which is refreshingly nice compared to my usual routine of being
                perpetually 5-10 minutes late to everything back in North Carolina. Anyway, I was walking through the
                train station this morning, not in a rush but just minding my own business and having a nice time
                watching people rushing around and stopping for coffee at the various shops. It also wasn't my first day
                in this train station, so I was relatively confident in where I was going and couldn't have looked
                nearly as confused or lost as I had the first day. I was walking along as one does, trying to avoid
                running into people who were late for their trains, when I crossed paths with a group of police officers
                (is there a name for that? if not then something like flock or gaggle could be good). Not unusual, as I
                had seen trios of police officers up on the balconies observing everything in my previous visits to the
                station. I kept walking without running straight into them which was good, still no issues. I had passed
                them now and heard a conversation pick up among them, in German of course. Unbeknownst to me, however,
                this conversation was not a mere chat among coworkers, but it was actually a conversation I was supposed
                to be part of. Of course I had no idea and kept walking which must've been pretty rude, as intentionally
                ignoring the police and walking away from them is a little more bold than my usual behavior. The noise
                wasn't getting quieter but starting getting louder, which was annoying so I figured I'd turn to see who
                they were trying to talk to and go the other direction to get out of the way. Turns out, it was me which
                was a fun surprise.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                When they realized I was catching on they formed a circle around me so I couldn't try to walk away
                again, and the one in the middle started speaking rapid-fire German at me. At this point very confused
                by this unexpected encounter, I wasn't sure what to say but figured the longer I stood still in silence
                the more suspicious it would be. Eventually I decided to say in English that I don't speak German so
                couldn't really do anything for them. Although that wasn't enough to get them to leave me alone, it was
                enough to get the one speaking to switch to the only language I could actually understand. I was
                relieved, but then he asked for my passport. This doesn't seem like an issue because luckily I had my
                passport with me, but once again I hesitated, which once again must have been suspicious or at least
                weird. I only hesitated because apparently some pickpockets work by disguising as police then asking to
                have your important information and documents before running off with them. So there I was in the middle
                of the train station surrounded by police officers once again not moving, unsure whether to hand over my
                identification and unsure of how to know if they really were in fact police officers. Asking seemed
                bold, but I could think of no other way of knowing and decided to assume based on previous sightings
                that they were fine, since being uncooperative or sassy with the German police seemed like a bad move.
                Anyway, I got out my passport and held it open hoping that'd be enough, but alas it wasn't and he
                grabbed it from my hand. By this point I was quite nervous from the situation, and this nervousness only
                increased when he paused for quite a while staring at my passport then began asking questions. I was
                still nervous since that doesn't just go away in the middle of something unexpected like this, but I
                managed to answer with the truth and tehy seemed to believe me. The last complication was that in
                flipping through my passport several times he missed the stamp from when I entered the country and grew
                even more suspicious, but eventually he found it, handed me back the passport without another word, and
                the group moved on silently. I was still thoroughly confused by what had just happened but saw no other
                logical step to take besides continuing to walk to my train, so I kept on going. Luckily thanks to the
                not being late thing I made it on time, but it was a bit of an unplanned detour.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                So even though the day got off to an interesting start, the train ride was enjoyable as ever and
                eventually we arrived in Salzburg. Aside from being cold and wet from the on-and-off snow and hail that
                fell down onto the city all afternoon, I had a nice time taking in the sites and the history. On the
                train ride home it took about 5 minutes of rolling along the tracks for me to fall into a relaxing nap
                that wouldn't end till we reached Munich again.
            </p>

            <h3 id="4">A Bavarian Nice Time</h3>
            <p class="info">
                Today I actually had a set schedule, which started with going to the U-Bahn across from where I was
                staying and figuring out a way to get back to the train station. This went much more smoothly than my
                U-Bahn experience yesterday, so it was nice getting off on the right foot today. I got to the station a
                little early and took a minute to people-watch as I got my thoughts together. It wasn't too crowded
                today, so the Munich Hbf felt less overwhelming and it became easier to get the hang of where I was and
                what I needed to do. The theme for the station was flowers. Large flowers made of brightly colored
                fabric and string hung from the ceiling, swaying gently every time a bird made its way into the station
                and flew around. Little flower stickers lined the glass walls of the balconies where people would go for
                a break from the hustle and bustle on the platforms below. Sitting on a bench on one of these balconies
                while waiting for my train I could feel the intimidation of the sprawling train station creeping away as
                a new excitement for the adventure ahead took its place.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                The train ride was again peaceful and picturesque, but there were decidedly more animals passing by. We
                did have to change trains once, but the closer we got to the mountains the more common it became to see
                dairy farms with cows and other animals grazing in the pastures that ran along the hills. In addition to
                cows, deer were also common. Because of how cheap milk is in Germany many farmers left that industry and
                decided instead to raise deer. I also learned that those little huts I kept seeing clustered in a big
                garden were actually for rent. People living in city apartments could become a member of one of those
                communities and use one of those plots as a yard and place to grow a garden.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                After the second train, we had to take a bus. The issue was that the bus was not there and no one could
                get a hold of the driver so we waited for it outside an Aldi's for about a half hour. Then, once it came
                we rode through the countryside toward the Alps until we reached the castle. It was a mile hike up into
                the mountains to reach the castle but it came with great information about the history of the castle and
                incredible views. The hike itself was pleasant and scenic, and it involved crossing over tiny brooks and
                passing little patches of snow. Before entering the castle we went up to the bride above it to take in
                the scenery. The views were indeed spectacular, but what was not spectacular was how the boards all
                moved and sagged each time anyone took a step, especially considering the height and that there didn't
                seem to be a limit to how many people were crammed on the bridge. Inside the castle, everything was
                ornately decorated and epitomized the regal splendor and intricate detail associated with a true
                fairytale castle. Learning the backstory of its designer King Ludwig added some perspective and provided
                insight into the region's history. On the way back from the castle we stopped for donut holes from a
                local vendor. They were made with something in between cream cheese and greek yogurt and they were
                delicious, partly because they were so warm and I hadn't eaten lunch yet so I was hungry in addition to
                being cold. The ride back to Munich was peaceful, so much so that I actually did fall aslepp this time.
            </p>

            <h3 id="3">Making it to Munich</h3>
            <p class="info">
                The day began before 7am which I'd normally complain about for being too early, but I gladly made an
                exception for today.
                The excitement of getting to take a 3 hour train ride overrode all my tiredness and crankiness,
                especially when I got breakfast and decided to go a little crazy and have a latte macchiato (fancy
                coffee of some mystery variety) along with it.
                I then made my way to the Frankfurt Main train station, which was exactly how I had pictured a grand
                station to be, only more exciting.
                It was still relatively early on a Sunday so it wasn't too crowded, which I was glad about considering
                I'd never navigated taking the train before.
                The entrance was magnificent - it was large and imposing, but not enough to be intimidating, just enough
                to make you eager to walk the 20 more steps to get inside and see what it held inside.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                When I walked in I couldn't help but gasp. There were signs and platforms everywhere. People were
                rushing about, all seemingly knowing exactly where to go.
                It took me a minute to take in all the splendor, then another to figure out where I was and where I
                needed to be.
                Walking around the station was one of those times when I realized I was on a real life adventure, and I
                could make it whatever I wanted.

                There was such a mix of people, from adults with a briefcase to young families with children dressed in
                colorful coats to tourists bogged down with luggage, all on their way somewhere new.
                I eventually left the bustling station and boarded the train from Frankfurt to Munich, and I've got to
                say I loved traveling by train! The views were spectacular and the ride was a nice relaxing time to get
                some work done.

                When I first got on the ICE 1125 I immediately scanned for open places to sit and managed to snag a
                window seat (my favorite no matter the type of transportation).
                I did some 426 prep, but repeatedly found myself caught in a trance-like stare out the window,
                captivated by the rolling countryside and small, cozy towns passing by.
                No matter the size of the village, there was always a steeple of some sort sticking up above the red
                rooftops, and most of these towns were bordered on the side by a gently-flowing stream.
                Every once in a while a cluster of windmills or solar panels would float by, exemplifying the country's
                commitment to the environment and renewable resources.
                I saw a few horses grazing about, and what appeared to be deer-like animals in the far edges of some of
                the landscapes. Mostly, though, there were rectangular fields of brown, yellow, or green.
                When the sun found one of the yellow canola plots, the entire landscape seemed to glow. And when the sun
                got tangled in the trees on the hills, it cast a sleepy, muted light that lingered into the next scene.
                With such spectacular scenery, it's a wonder I got any work done at all.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                The train made a few stops on the way to Munich but I didn't have to get off or move or switch trains
                which was nice. After each stop, a woman would walk by selling 'kaffee oder cappuccinos' to passengers
                for a few euros.
                I had so recently had breakfast that I didn't buy any train coffee, but it's a good thing I had that
                coffee this morning or else the gentle rocking of the train, the soft murmur of conversations in German
                happening all around me, and the mesmerizing countryside passing by could've easily lured me into a
                peaceful nap.

            <p class="info">
                Once in Munich I got lost in the train station trying to find my way out. Compared to the Frankfurt
                station, the Munich Hbf was less picturesque but larger and more crowded, with more people-watching to
                be done.
                There was construction going on so maybe that's why I had trouble finding the main way out, but the
                other factor was that there didn't seem to be any grand entrance/exit like there was in Frankfurt. I
                tried a few exits but didn't find the streets or landmarks I was searching for, and ended up going out
                and coming back in more than a few times trying to figure it out.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                You may be asking yourself at this point why I didn't just look at a map, to which my response is good
                question but please keep the questions till the end so I can finish telling the story. Anyway, I kind of
                did look at a map, but I wanted to figure it out myself and there were also a few problems with the map
                thing: the maps in the station are basically all of rail routes and mostly without street names, and the
                maps I had were fine but a little limited on information and were harder to figure out in terms of
                orientation and direction. At some point I figured I should just try an exit and go with it, so I walked
                back to the exit with views of the biggest church since that seemed like something I had remembered
                needing to pass by, and headed that way.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                From there I began wandering the city which has got to be one of my new favorite activities. I've got no
                schedule, nowhere to be, and nothing but time to explore the city and my thoughts.
                Though I was on my own, I encountered a few tour groups here and there and overheard some of the stories
                the guides were telling (one was in Spanish so some parts went over my head but I was still able to pick
                up a decent amount of it).
                Although I had no formal tour, I was fascinated once again by the architecture and curated a list of
                things about the city to read up on later.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                I took my time walking around which means I witnessed the passing of a few hours and heard the tolls of
                the church bells every fifteen minutes. And let me tell you, there were a lot of bells.
                Each block of the city seemed to have its own church, with its own grand bell tower reaching several
                stories into the air. It was a little jarring to hear them all going off at once, but hearing the
                various echoes of them all mixing together was a fun momentary diversion.
                It got extra interesting when this coincided with passing by a street performer. There were a few
                scattered about the city, mostly playing gentle accordion or violin music.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                It was rainy and roughly 40 degrees (Fahrenheit), but I didn't mind at all. I got a little cold, but
                when it started to bug me I decided to stop into a cafe for some food and warmth.
                And that's when things got exciting again. In case you haven't heard or have not been keeping track, at
                this point in my trip I had said a total of four words in German (ja, nein, und, and danke). Since I
                arrived in Germany it had been on my list to use at least one phrase in German instead of solely relying
                on English. But every time I had the chance the nerves set in and the plan was always quickly abandoned
                in favor of looks of confusion, some nodding, pointing, and a few timid English words. But today it
                finally happened, and I can't quite say why.
                Maybe it was because of the guy in front of me in line, who said one word and pointed to what he wanted,
                getting only short German remarks back from the employee behind the counter. Or maybe I was just tired
                of the disappointment that comes with getting scared at the last minute all the time.
                Either way, I managed to order in German!
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                I still nodded and pointed since switching over completely with no help or safety net seemed risky and
                possibly quite confusing for the employee depending on how far off I was, but not a single word of
                English came out of my mouth which was pretty exciting for me. I must admit, though, that despite not
                speaking any English during the interaction, I accidentally spoke Spanish several times.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                The problem with ordering in German is that sometimes (like this time today) they respond with follow-up
                questions, also in German. In case you weren't sure, those questions happen to be different from the one
                phrase I had memorized and used to order, so I was a little stuck. This is where the nodding and
                pointing came back into play and saved the day.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                What didn't help anyone was my attempt at still having some sort of verbal answer in addition to that. I
                was focused enough to realize English was not going to work, but didn't have my act together enough to
                respond in German (even though I do know how to say yes and no in German, and was assuming these were
                yes or no questions despite having no actual idea whether they were or not - that's a separate issue for
                another day or never who knows). So I had ruled out German for some reason, definitely ruled out
                English, and somehow settled on Spanish.
                So there I was responding 's√≠' and 'no' to a bunch of questions I still don't know the meaning of. I
                realized it each time and tried to correct it only when it was too late and the Spanish had already
                slipped out, but I didn't mind too much as I was still pleased with the initial ordering part happening
                in German.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                After resting up for a bit, doing a little more work, and feuling up I headed back out into the city.
                Now is probably a good time to mention that today I had to face and live with my packing choices. Here I
                was taking the train and wandering around Munich with everything I had brought from America with me. As
                I was walking (and slipping and tripping) on the wet cobblestone streets I noticed how nice it was to
                only have one backpack on and not have to worry about anything else. Sure it was pretty heavy (perhaps I
                still overpacked), but I wasn't concerned with dragging a wheeled suitcase through the uneven streets,
                and I wasn't worried about forgetting a purse or small bag or anything. It really was quite convenient
                for absent-mindedly wandering around.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                Anyway, back to the story. The rain lightened up as I was slowly heading back to the train station. I
                didn't get lost on the way back which was only mildly surprising but pretty nice. Once there things
                started going downhill for a bit when I had trouble getting the ticket thing figured out for the U-Bahn
                underground train to take to where I was staying. I was tired and confused and the lady at the
                information desk was rude and not helpful, so the frustration was sinking in. Luckily, a nice old
                gentleman noticed the trouble I was having and helped me out, making sure I made it all the way to the
                platform for the train itself before disappearing. At that point the eventfulness of the day was mostly
                done, and overall I'd say it was a pretty great day.
            </p>

            <p class="info">
                I'll start off by making a general note, which is that I have seen so many dogs. Mostly they have been
                small and fluffy but not always. Generally, no matter the size of the dog, they have been well-behaved
                and calm. Also, a lot of owners let their dogs wander freely without a leash (they still have the leash
                they just don't use it), even while weaving through lots of people on crowded streets!
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                I wandered the city for a bit, first stopping by a nice bridge featured in one of the Now You See Me
                movies that had a bunch of love locks on it. I then made it to R√∂merburg where I explored the square and
                had a bratwurst for dinner. There was some promotional event for the museums happening, so it was quite
                crowded. The surprising part was when an organized performance began in the middle of the square, with
                the performers dressed in costumes and pale makeup. They didn't speak, but moved according to music
                mostly reliant on a heavy, steady-beating drum. Torchers lit with fire were swung around, and some of
                the actors got into a cage made of ropes while the others climbed upon it and moved it in circles.
                Although I found this somehwat confusing, everyone else present seemed enthusiastic and to enjoy the
                performance, applauding and cheering loudly for the actors when it finished.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                By this point it had gotten dark out, so I decided to start walking back. I ended up on a different
                route from the one I took to get there, so it was interesting to see the city lights at night but also
                unfamiliar territory. I unknowingly overshot my turn by a block or two, but started to question where I
                was when it seemed a little off. At this point I turned and walked straight toward the river, knowing I
                could probably follow that better until I found a landmark I recognized since I knew I couldn't be too
                far off. As I was approaching the water, I realized I was walking straight into one of two bridges on
                either side of my hotel, so I had enough of an idea where I was to be fine. Instead of making another
                (this time correct) turn to get back, I decided to cross the bridge because it seemed nice and why not.
                As I reached the arched middle, I could see clusters of distant but bright lights and silhouettes of
                lots of people moving in the dark, so I decided to check out what all the fuss was about.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                As it turns out, I had accidentally stumbled upon the opening night celebrations for Ruderfest, the
                three-day rowing festival in Frankfurt. There were street vendors selling food and of course beer,
                little tents with carnival games, and a concert by the Roxx Busters who happen to be a rock tribute
                band. To my surprise and delight, they played several songs I knew from bands like Journey and Queen,
                and everyone in the crowd was singing along. The other thing was that since so many people smoke, they
                were all waving real lighters in the air instead of just cell phones. I stayed for a while, listening to
                the sounds of the concert from up on the nearby bridge and watching boats go by on the river. Eventually
                I headed back, staying near enough to the river to manage walking the rest of the way without getting
                lost again.
            </p>

            <h3 id="1">Let's Start at the Very Beginning (a very good place to start)</h3>
            <p class="info">
                After the semester ended it was a quick turnaround from Chapel Hill to Charlotte to New York on my way
                out of the country. Just enough time to take a break but not too much, so that I could be organized
                enough not to panic while still winging most of it.
                I got to take the airport tram in New York to change terminals from my flight from Charlotte to my
                flight to Frankfurt, which unbeknownst to me involved going through security again. Before re-entering
                the airport I wandered for a bit, got a new ticket to reflect the flight with Singapore Airlines instead
                of JetBlue, and stood in what had to have been the longest security line I've ever been in.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                Then it was onto the flight. And wow what a flight! In that eight hour period I ate more (and fancier)
                food than I'd had in a long time - they served a snack, dinner, ice cream, breakfast, and beverages
                throughout the flight. During boarding there was light classical music while flight attendants
                distributed headphones and socks. Each seat came equipped with a soft blanket and a cushy pillow.
                Also, this was the biggest plane I had ever seen. It was huge, both from the perspective of looking at
                it through the airport window and of gazing across the many rows of seats once on board.
                I read my book (Brave not Perfect, which came recommended by Hailey and mom), and managed to sleep on
                and off for a total of 3ish hours.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                In the Frankfurt airport I stumbled around for a bit looking for a SIM card for my phone which I
                eventually found and charging up my phone before heading out into the city. I walked a few streets in
                the city, but mostly just to get food so I could go back and eat something before falling immediately
                asleep.
            </p>

            <h3 id="0">Hallo World</h3>
            <p class="info">
                I'm off to see the world, starting in Frankfurt, Germany. Currently the only German words I know are
