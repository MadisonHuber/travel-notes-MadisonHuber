A travel blog about my study abroad experience

This is the travel blog I created while traveling and studying abroad. Some of the tools I built it with are Express, React, Handlebars, TypeScript, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Parcel, Netlify, Node.js, and AWS EC2. You can find it [here](http://maddie.introcs.com/).
