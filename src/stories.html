                        We did not have to get up at 6:00am today! I did wake up around 8 though and I didn't even feel tired! It's possible this has something to do with the fact that I went to bed at 10pm last night, which is incredibly early and really just completely unheard of. Who knew going to sleep at a reasonable hour could be so beneficial. Anyway I wasn't tired which was good since we stopped at a modern art museum and a museum sort of about evolution and Danish history on the way back to Copenhagen. On the ride back I wasn't asleep, contrary to the early morning trip to get to Aarhus, so I was able to do a little work and even read my book. I also got to look out the window for a while, and which brought to mind two observations, first that there really are a lot of wind turbines, and second that there are no billboards along the road which is a nice break from America where you'll see two or three in stacks that rise up as far ahead as you can see.

                    <summary>A Jelling Good Time in Jutland</summary>
                    <p class="info">
                        6:00am is too early for people to wake up. No one could possibly be clear-headed and productive so early in the morning, which is just the excuse I think I'll go with for why I ended up in such impractical and painful shoes today. With a meeting time of 6:45am and a tendency to oversleep just a little, I was in a bit of a hurry this morning. I knew the agenda included a trip to the historic Jelling Stones and a talk at Google, which I'd have to look presentable for. Not wanting to deal with changing later and packing more clothes I just went with the business casual from the start of the day.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Our stop on the way to Aarhus was to learn some Danish history and see the old Jelling Stones which were a pretty big deal in establishing the country as it would come to be known today. It was cold, rainy, and windy, but the guide did a good job anyway and soon enough we were back on the bus on the way to Aarhus.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Before making it to Google we stopped for a quick lunch at a nice place with a bunch of vendors offering different kinds of food. After that it was a short ride on the bus over to Google where we heard a talk from Dr. Mads Ager, who was instrumental in working on the V8 JavaScript engine. He did a fantastic job, explaining some of the background of V8 and how Google managed to establish a 30-person office in Aarhus, Denmark. It was really cool to hear him talk about concepts I had learned about in school (especially all the things that came up which I was able to recognize from 590). To begin the talk he gave some life advice about taking the time and putting in the effort to find something you really love doing and are interested in, which I thought was a good way to start and good to hear in general as someone still trying to figure out where to go with my life.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Dr. Ager was truly excited about everything he talked about, and he knew how to cover complex topics at a level we could understand and discuss in a short period of time. I also appreciated the thought he gave when taking and answering questions we had. He also talked about his current project, something like the Dex compiler used in Android devices, JavaScript engines and how changes in ECMAScript work with Google and others involved like Microsoft or Mozilla, the importance of thorough testing, the practice of code review at Google, and doing work that makes an impact.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        After Google, we checked into the hotel and walked around Aarhus, which was fun, especially for people wearing sensible shoes. Unfortunately, as previously mentioned my shoes were less than sensible and more on the painful side, but I still enjoyed seeing the city. The library had a bunch of playground structures which was an unexpected diversion before going to a fancy dinner. They had chicken sandwiches and french fries and bread all with really good side sauce. The highlight was the ice cream they served, though the apple, lemon, and cinnamon flavors were unusual and quite strong. Aarhus also had a nice rooftop deck in the middle of things that overlooked the city, providing great views of everything.

                    <p class="info">
                        Our morning started with a talk on Danish culture and language. The focus was mainly on how trusting the Danes are and how this impacts various parts of their society. We learned some Danish phrases and discussed things we had noticed about the culture as well as how such things compared with life in America. We then got prepared for our weekened trip and had class in the afternoon. The day ended with a picnic along the river, which was a great hands-on example of the concept of hygge we had learned about.

                        I woke up on time today! Instead of going right to class, we spent the morning on a bike tour of
                        Copenhagen. This was my first time riding a bike in several years but I was mostly okay on the
                        bike.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Biking in Copenhagen is serious. They don’t mess around when it comes to cycling through the
                        streets, which is good for safety but also a little intimidating. The use of hand signals is
                        common, and most streets have nice bike lanes which make it less scary even though you’re still
                        often riding alongside cars on your left and pedestrians on your right. There are also no left
                        turns which was good to know before we started our tour. In order to make it to the departure
                        point of the tour we had to ride a few blocks as a group, which was nice preparation for the
                        tour. When we started off Kris took the lead which was good since no one had any idea where to
                        go, but he did start off by making sure we knew that if we got separated from the group then we
                        were on our own to figure it out with Google Maps. Then he took off and we scrambled to keep up.
                        But the tour guide felt it more necessary to make sure everyone was always accounted for which
                        took some pressure off.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The tour guide took us through four neighborhoods with stops along the way to hear about the
                        city and various aspects of life in Copenhagen. I learned lots of things, like how it’s common
                        on a street to see the bike lane wider than the lane for cars and buses, or that secularization
                        has been such a big thing that many churches have been sold and now have other functions or are
                        still churches but don’t advertise their religion.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        We had lunch in a community center that was one of those places that used to be a church. It was
                        easy to tell the building used to be a church, but it was nice to see it so full of people
                        working and hanging out together there in the middle of a Wednesday morning. It wasn’t an
                        intimidating or imposing structure, but rather welcoming and bright. The inside was painted in
                        light pinks and greens and oranges and other colors, and the center was filled with long tables
                        and places to sit. There, we had oksedeller for lunch, which was some sort of chorizo with rice
                        and a tomato sauce, topped with pomegranate and cilantro. It was warm and delicious and quite
                        filling, which was just what we needed to refuel for the bike ride back. All the biking was nice
                        but I’m definitely going to be sore.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        In the afternoon we had class which was fun. The day pretty heavily resembled a day in COMP590,
                        which I loved. I learned more about JavaScript, language features, support of various features
                        across different browsers, transpilers, and how things like HTML and JavaScript work together
                        which was cool.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        After class we headed off to a picnic put on by DIS. It was crowded and a little chilly but we
                        got hot dogs and chips and some Danish water and soda, so it was a good free meal and a nice
                        break from 426 before heading back home to work on tonight’s assignment.

                    <p class="info">
                        Today started with a boring and useless welcome ceremony at 8:30am which is a little early for
                        something so unnecessary. The only upsides were that it was in a cool building and they had live
                        music thrown in there to try to keep us awake, though it was only somewhat successful on that
                        front. Next, we stopped in a coffee shop before getting lost on the way to class.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        We were mostly together which helped in trying to figure out where to go, but from the direction
                        we came the classroom was in a building hidden behind two other buildings (though we did
                        eventually find a clearer way to get there). Luckily Kris saw us wandering around all confused
                        from up in the classroom window and came down to lead us there. The room was quite nice, again
                        spacious and bright, though upon first glance I didn't notice too many outlets which may cause
                        trouble but we'll see.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Though we met back at UNC, today still counts as the Copenhagen First Day of Class which is
                        always an exciting
                        day, regardless of what country you're in. I'm not gonna lie I wasn't initially excited about
                        the first part of the lesson which focused on some design concepts to watch out for, like
                        typography. But it was absolutely interesting how so much goes into the text on the screen and
                        how humans read it and the effects of styling things different ways, even though it still felt a
                        little out of reach for what I felt were my skills and with where I was at. Playing around with
                        it later was fun, though. The other nice part of the morning class was learning a Danish word!
                        (for those of you who are curious, the word is tak and it means thank you)
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Then we had a break for lunch (cereal) and started up in the afternoon talking about JavaScript,
                        which was so fun. I learned about lots of interesting things like the symbol type, variable
                        hoisting, and different types of functions. This also made me more excited to get into using
                        JavaScript and soon TypeScript!
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        We had a bit of a break after class before heading to a group dinner at a nice Mediterranean
                        place. There was lots of food, all of which is pretty far from my usual diet. Despite being
                        uncommon for me the food was delicious. I had some potatoes, pita, other colorful vegetable
                        stuff, and a pice of falafel which did indeed taste better than the falafel I had at 3:00am at
                        the last Hack110. It was a great dinner which left me full and ready to do a little more work
                        before calling it a night in preparation for the big bike tour tomorrow.

                    <p class="info">
                        After getting off the night bus in Copenhagen we walked over to Selina's hostel and continued
                        working on 426 for a few hours. Around noon we headed to the airport to check in for DIS! Even
                        though I'd been working on stuff for class for a while now, seeing the DIS people and other
                        students gathered together made study abroad feel much more real. They provided snacks and water
                        for us, gave us some necessary information to make sure we had everything we'd need to get
                        started, then took us (by bus, but nicer and with fewer flies than the one last night) to where
                        we'd be living for the next three weeks. We met with more DIS people and got all settled in, and
                        I was so pleasantly surprised to discover just how nice the building we're staying in is. The
                        common areas are bright and inviting, and the bedrooms are spacious with large windows and
                        comfortable furniture.

                    <p class="info">
                        Though I wanted to procrastinate forever on unpacking all my stuff, there was an orientation
                        meeting at 5 and pizza at 6 to motivate me to finish in a decent amount of time. I was pretty
                        tired but managed to get mostly organized. And then came the snacks and pizza, which I was so
                        excited for. I hadn't had pizza since America but it's one of those things that just always
                        sounds good. Free food is always nice, but add on the fact that I was hungry and the part about
                        it being pizza of all foods, and I was pretty happy when I finally had a warm slice in my hand.
                        I even tried artichoke pizza, and I've got to say the extra toppings on it added some nice
                        flavor and texture to the already delicious pizza.

                        Today of course began with some 426 prep, but after working for a while we headed to see the
                        Berlin Wall. We followed a path along the wall and took in all the murals painted along it as
                        part of the East Side Gallery. We also went to a nice cafe for some fancy Baumkuchen chocolate
                        cake which was quite delicious. After this we headed back to the train station to wait for our
                        night bus to Copenhagen.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The fancy train station had a McDonald's with German food they don't have in America so that was
                        interesting, and they also had an Ampelmann store! The Ampelmann is the cute little green man in
                        the walk symbol for pedestrians throughout streets in Berlin. It has also expanded into quite a
                        brand, selling everything from bath robes to pasta.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Eventually we got on the bus around 10:30, and it was nice aside from a fly infestation and WiFi
                        that didn't work. This took us to a ferry around 5:00 am, and we eventually made it to
                        Copenhagen a little before 8:00 am. I slept some on the ride so hopefully that'll help with
                        getting on track with a better sleep schedule in time for the start of class.

                        The day started as they have been recently, with me working on 426. Later on Selina came to
                        Berlin and we made our way through the city, stopping in notable place like Alexanderplatz and
                        the Brandenburg Gate. As we walked through the city we noticed a bunch of bear statues
                        everywhere. As it turns out, these bears are Buddy Bears, which have been the symbol of Berlin
                        since the early 2000s. The bear is part of Berlin's coat of arms, and these bears specifically
                        are meant to promote unity, kindness, tolerance, optimism, and other positive sentiments.

                        I also tried currywurst today, which was basically a fancy hot dog with really thick ketchup and
                        curry. It was a little spicy but not too much, and overall I'd say it was pretty good. We got a
                        little lost coming back when the metro line we needed wasn't running but we eventually made it.

                        This morning when I woke up, I knew I was checking out of my hotel, but I didn't know a thing
                        beyond
                        that. Before I started to pack I decided I'd head to Berlin, Germany. It was a step closer to
                        Copenhagen
                        so why not. So I was able to book a ticket for a train to get there, but that's about it. I
                        checked out
                        fine then hurried off to the train station so I wouldn't miss the train. The tricky thing about
                        taking
                        the train from Prague is that they don't have platform numbers listed on your ticket, so you
                        must go and
                        watch the screens, waiting for them to update with departing trains, times, and platforms. This
                        information is only displayed in full around 20 minutes prior to departure, so you've got to
                        make sure
                        you know where things are so you can get to whichever platform you need to be at in time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The train was quite crowded this time, but the ride was scenic as usual. About halfway through
                        the train
                        ride was when I spent more time trying to figure out my plans. I knew I still didn't have a
                        place to
                        stay in Berlin, so I figured I'd start with that since I was already on my way there. I did find
                        somewhere so there's no need to worry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The Berlin train station was huge. It was bigger than any other I had been to, with somewhere
                        around 5
                        stories. There were about as many restaurants and shops as one would find in a decent sized
                        shopping
                        mall. The cool part was standing in the middle, watching trains go by above you and below you at
                        the
                        same time.

                    <p class="info">
                        From there I got settled into the new city, went for a walk in a nearby park, and ended the day
                        by doing
                        some work for 426. Although I'm not in Copenhagen yet, today was the last day of my solo
                        traveling. I
                        still have one or two days in Germany before I leave for Denmark. I'm not quite sure if it'll be
                        one or
                        two as I haven't planned that far ahead, but we'll see.

                    <p class="info">
                        I am writing to inform you that everything is fine now — but what a long 24 hours it's been!
                        After
                        finally settling in last night I decided to try to tackle some more GRQs. The problem, however,
                        was that
                        my computer and charger decided to team up against me and make it impossible to charge my
                        computer. I'm
                        not sure why they did this but I certainly didn't appreciate it. This has happened to me once
                        before,
                        but I tried everything I could then to fix it, let it rest, and came back the next morning to a
                        happily
                        charging computer. So, I figured I should again try everything I could think of or find to try
                        to fix it
                        as I wasn't fired up about the idea of facing the death of my computer with no apparent means
                        for
                        revival. So I did all the same things as last time, the nervousness increasing as each attempt
                        failed
                        and as the battery slowly ticked lower and lower, making its way all the way to 0%. Tensions
                        were high
                        now, but I could feel my time and hope slipping away the whole time, so although I wasn't
                        surprised when
                        it finally reached 0% as I had known it was coming, there was still the realization that as much
                        as I
                        hated leaving it in such a state, I could do nothing more right then and would have to wait
                        until the
                        next day to try something new.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        So, when I woke up and eventually got over my bad mood enough to do something about the problem
                        I headed
                        to some tech support store as Prague does not have an Apple store. They told me there was an I/O
                        issue
                        in my computer itself and that my charger was broken, so lots of good news. I told them no thank
                        you
                        when they asked to keep it for 2&ndash;3 days to fix it, and tried to just get a new charger but
                        unfortunately
                        they happened to be out of stock. So the closest place I found that sold one was a mall, which
                        was quite
                        fancy and had a KFC and a McDonald's in its food court.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The new charger seems to be working fine now, so
                        after I got it I headed into Old Town to check it out and go exploring. I did see some cool
                        sights, and
                        was able to get a glimpse of the Astronomical Clock at the top of the hour. I also tried a
                        Trdelník, which was some sort of cone made of sweet dough filled with whipped cream and
                        strawberries.

                    <summary>From Munich to Music</summary>
                    <p class="info">
                        The train ride from Munich to Prague was nice as usual, though this time the scenery consisted
                        of more
                        forests, lakes, and large rock forms. The developed land we passed once crossing into the Czech
                        Repulic
                        was more run-down than what I had seen in Germany and Austria. Once we arrived, I walked around
                        the
                        train station for a bit. It was large and ornate in some areas with enough shops to constitute a
                        shopping mall. My favorite feature of the train station was the piano sitting in the center.
                        Anyone who
                        walked by would slow down as they passed in front of it, with expressions on their faces
                        reflecting the
                        internal debate of whether to spare a minute to play in the crowded space or to continue on
                        their way.
                        The first person I saw to play was a young child. Despite her age she was focused and played
                        well, even
                        with her dad standing over her shoulder. Her playing so calmly in the crowded station must have
                        helped
                        others realize their own bravery; once she finished, other travelers took turns playing a song
                        or two
                        before letting someone else have a chance. This formed an ongoing stream of music, sometimes
                        faint and
                        timid but sometimes with enough force such that the escaping sound drowned out the announcements
                        on the
                        speaker. A school group even passed through with each student taking a few minutes to play.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        It had been months since I last heard a piano, and even longer (if ever) since I had heard full
                        sonatas
                        and concertos, especially coming effortlessly from the fingers of young children. The other
                        thing this
                        demonstrated was just how many people could easily sit down on the spot and play beautiful songs
                        from
                        memory without messing up a note all the while acting like it was nothing. What happened next
                        was quite
                        surprising, and I'm not sure what brought it on, but a few moments after the stream of secret
                        musicians
                        ended, I found myslef walking to the little round stool that sat facing the keys. Before I knew
                        it I had
                        started to play what little I remember, and almost immediately after beginning a feeling of
                        excitement
                        and freedom struck me. And when it did, I realized just how long it had been since I experienced
                        such a
                        thrill. Once so afraid (and maybe in normal circumstances still so afraid), I was sitting there
                        letting
                        the muscle memory carry me through the song as my heart raced. As I have forgotten most of what
                        I
                        learned as a child, I wasn't playing for long, but I won't soon forget the excitement that came
                        along
                        with sitting there realizing what I was doing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Despite some complications leaving the station and settling in at where I was staying, I'd still
                        classify this as a pretty great day. I did something that completely surprised me, and managed
                        to make
                        it through without getting nervous or freaking out even after it hit me what I was doing. It
                        certainly
                        wasn't planned (which isn't surprising given how little planning I ever do), but I'm glad it
                        happened,
                        even if I'm still not quite sure how I did it.

                    <p class="info">
                        Not getting on a normal sleep schedule has been a little annoying and very tiring, but it also
                        means
                        another day of not being late which is refreshingly nice compared to my usual routine of being
                        perpetually 5&ndash;10 minutes late to everything back in North Carolina. Anyway, I was walking
                        through the
                        train station this morning, not in a rush but just minding my own business and having a nice
                        time
                        watching people rushing around and stopping for coffee at the various shops. It also wasn't my
                        first day
                        in this train station, so I was relatively confident in where I was going and couldn't have
                        looked
                        nearly as confused or lost as I had the first day. I was walking along as one does, trying to
                        avoid
                        running into people who were late for their trains, when I crossed paths with a group of police
                        officers
                        (is there a name for that? if not then something like flock or gaggle could be good). Not
                        unusual, as I
                        had seen trios of police officers up on the balconies observing everything in my previous visits
                        to the
                        station. I kept walking without running straight into them which was good, still no issues. I
                        had passed
                        them now and heard a conversation pick up among them, in German of course. Unbeknownst to me,
                        however,
                        this conversation was not a mere chat among coworkers, but it was actually a conversation I was
                        supposed
                        to be part of. Of course I had no idea and kept walking which must've been pretty rude, as
                        intentionally
                        ignoring the police and walking away from them is a little more bold than my usual behavior. The
                        noise
                        wasn't getting quieter but starting getting louder, which was annoying so I figured I'd turn to
                        see who
                        they were trying to talk to and go the other direction to get out of the way. Turns out, it was
                        me which
                        was a fun surprise.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        When they realized I was catching on they formed a circle around me so I couldn't try to walk
                        away
                        again, and the one in the middle started speaking rapid-fire German at me. At this point very
                        confused
                        by this unexpected encounter, I wasn't sure what to say but figured the longer I stood still in
                        silence
                        the more suspicious it would be. Eventually I decided to say in English that I don't speak
                        German so
                        couldn't really do anything for them. Although that wasn't enough to get them to leave me alone,
                        it was
                        enough to get the one speaking to switch to the only language I could actually understand. I was
                        relieved, but then he asked for my passport. This doesn't seem like an issue because luckily I
                        had my
                        passport with me, but once again I hesitated, which once again must have been suspicious or at
                        least
                        weird. I only hesitated because apparently some pickpockets work by disguising as police then
                        asking to
                        have your important information and documents before running off with them. So there I was in
                        the middle
                        of the train station surrounded by police officers once again not moving, unsure whether to hand
                        over my
                        identification and unsure of how to know if they really were in fact police officers. Asking
                        seemed
                        bold, but I could think of no other way of knowing and decided to assume based on previous
                        sightings
                        that they were fine, since being uncooperative or sassy with the German police seemed like a bad
                        move.
                        Anyway, I got out my passport and held it open hoping that'd be enough, but alas it wasn't and
                        he
                        grabbed it from my hand. By this point I was quite nervous from the situation, and this
                        nervousness only
                        increased when he paused for quite a while staring at my passport then began asking questions. I
                        was
                        still nervous since that doesn't just go away in the middle of something unexpected like this,
                        but I
                        managed to answer with the truth and tehy seemed to believe me. The last complication was that
                        in
                        flipping through my passport several times he missed the stamp from when I entered the country
                        and grew
                        even more suspicious, but eventually he found it, handed me back the passport without another
                        word, and
                        the group moved on silently. I was still thoroughly confused by what had just happened but saw
                        no other
                        logical step to take besides continuing to walk to my train, so I kept on going. Luckily thanks
                        to the
                        not being late thing I made it on time, but it was a bit of an unplanned detour.

                        So even though the day got off to an interesting start, the train ride was enjoyable as ever and
                        eventually we arrived in Salzburg. Aside from being cold and wet from the on-and-off snow and
                        hail that
                        fell down onto the city all afternoon, I had a nice time taking in the sites and the history. On
                        the
                        train ride home it took about 5 minutes of rolling along the tracks for me to fall into a
                        relaxing nap
                        that wouldn't end till we reached Munich again.

                    <p class="info">
                        Today I actually had a set schedule, which started with going to the U-Bahn across from where I
                        was
                        staying and figuring out a way to get back to the train station. This went much more smoothly
                        than my
                        U-Bahn experience yesterday, so it was nice getting off on the right foot today. I got to the
                        station a
                        little early and took a minute to people-watch as I got my thoughts together. It wasn't too
                        crowded
                        today, so the Munich Hbf felt less overwhelming and it became easier to get the hang of where I
                        was and
                        what I needed to do. The theme for the station was flowers. Large flowers made of brightly
                        colored
                        fabric and string hung from the ceiling, swaying gently every time a bird made its way into the
                        station
                        and flew around. Little flower stickers lined the glass walls of the balconies where people
                        would go for
                        a break from the hustle and bustle on the platforms below. Sitting on a bench on one of these
                        balconies
                        while waiting for my train I could feel the intimidation of the sprawling train station creeping
                        away as
                        a new excitement for the adventure ahead took its place.

                    <p class="info">
                        The train ride was again peaceful and picturesque, but there were decidedly more animals passing
                        by. We
                        did have to change trains once, but the closer we got to the mountains the more common it became
                        to see
                        dairy farms with cows and other animals grazing in the pastures that ran along the hills. In
                        addition to
                        cows, deer were also common. Because of how cheap milk is in Germany many farmers left that
                        industry and
                        decided instead to raise deer. I also learned that those little huts I kept seeing clustered in
                        a big
                        garden were actually for rent. People living in city apartments could become a member of one of
                        those
                        communities and use one of those plots as a yard and place to grow a garden.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        After the second train, we had to take a bus. The issue was that the bus was not there and no
                        one could
                        get a hold of the driver so we waited for it outside an Aldi's for about a half hour. Then, once
                        it came
                        we rode through the countryside toward the Alps until we reached the castle. It was a mile hike
                        up into
                        the mountains to reach the castle but it came with great information about the history of the
                        castle and
                        incredible views. The hike itself was pleasant and scenic, and it involved crossing over tiny
                        brooks and
                        passing little patches of snow. Before entering the castle we went up to the bride above it to
                        take in
                        the scenery. The views were indeed spectacular, but what was not spectacular was how the boards
                        all
                        moved and sagged each time anyone took a step, especially considering the height and that there
                        didn't
                        seem to be a limit to how many people were crammed on the bridge. Inside the castle, everything
                        was
                        ornately decorated and epitomized the regal splendor and intricate detail associated with a true
                        fairytale castle. Learning the backstory of its designer King Ludwig added some perspective and
                        provided
                        insight into the region's history. On the way back from the castle we stopped for donut holes
                        from a
                        local vendor. They were made with something in between cream cheese and greek yogurt and they
                        were
                        delicious, partly because they were so warm and I hadn't eaten lunch yet so I was hungry in
                        addition to
                        being cold. The ride back to Munich was peaceful, so much so that I actually did fall aslepp
                        this time.

                    <p class="info">
                        The day began before 7am which I'd normally complain about for being too early, but I gladly
                        made an
                        exception for today.
                        The excitement of getting to take a 3 hour train ride overrode all my tiredness and crankiness,
                        especially when I got breakfast and decided to go a little crazy and have a latte macchiato
                        (fancy
                        coffee of some mystery variety) along with it.
                        I then made my way to the Frankfurt Main train station, which was exactly how I had pictured a
                        grand
                        station to be, only more exciting.
                        It was still relatively early on a Sunday so it wasn't too crowded, which I was glad about
                        considering
                        I'd never navigated taking the train before.
                        The entrance was magnificent &mdash; it was large and imposing, but not enough to be
                        intimidating, just enough
                        to make you eager to walk the 20 more steps to get inside and see what it held inside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        When I walked in I couldn't help but gasp. There were signs and platforms everywhere. People
                        were
                        rushing about, all seemingly knowing exactly where to go.
                        It took me a minute to take in all the splendor, then another to figure out where I was and
                        where I
                        needed to be.
                        Walking around the station was one of those times when I realized I was on a real life
                        adventure, and I
                        could make it whatever I wanted.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        There was such a mix of people, from adults with a briefcase to young families with children
                        dressed in
                        colorful coats to tourists bogged down with luggage, all on their way somewhere new.
                        I eventually left the bustling station and boarded the train from Frankfurt to Munich, and I've
                        got to
                        say I loved traveling by train! The views were spectacular and the ride was a nice relaxing time
                        to get
                        some work done.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        When I first got on the ICE 1125 I immediately scanned for open places to sit and managed to
                        snag a
                        window seat (my favorite no matter the type of transportation).
                        I did some 426 prep, but repeatedly found myself caught in a trance-like stare out the window,
                        captivated by the rolling countryside and small, cozy towns passing by.
                        No matter the size of the village, there was always a steeple of some sort sticking up above the
                        red
                        rooftops, and most of these towns were bordered on the side by a gently flowing stream.
                        Every once in a while a cluster of windmills or solar panels would float by, exemplifying the
                        country's
                        commitment to the environment and renewable resources.
                        I saw a few horses grazing about, and what appeared to be deer-like animals in the far edges of
                        some of
                        the landscapes. Mostly, though, there were rectangular fields of brown, yellow, or green.
                        When the sun found one of the yellow canola plots, the entire landscape seemed to glow. And when
                        the sun
                        got tangled in the trees on the hills, it cast a sleepy, muted light that lingered into the next
                        scene.
                        With such spectacular scenery, it's a wonder I got any work done at all.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The train made a few stops on the way to Munich but I didn't have to get off or move or switch
                        trains
                        which was nice. After each stop, a woman would walk by selling 'kaffee oder cappuccinos' to
                        passengers
                        for a few euros.
                        I had so recently had breakfast that I didn't buy any train coffee, but it's a good thing I had
                        that
                        coffee this morning or else the gentle rocking of the train, the soft murmur of conversations in
                        German
                        happening all around me, and the mesmerizing countryside passing by could've easily lured me
                        into a
                        peaceful nap.

                    <p class="info">
                        Once in Munich I got lost in the train station trying to find my way out. Compared to the
                        Frankfurt
                        station, the Munich Hbf was less picturesque but larger and more crowded, with more
                        people-watching to
                        be done.
                        There was construction going on so maybe that's why I had trouble finding the main way out, but
                        the
                        other factor was that there didn't seem to be any grand entrance/exit like there was in
                        Frankfurt. I
                        tried a few exits but didn't find the streets or landmarks I was searching for, and ended up
                        going out
                        and coming back in more than a few times trying to figure it out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        You may be asking yourself at this point why I didn't just look at a map, to which my response
                        is good
                        question but please keep the questions till the end so I can finish telling the story. Anyway, I
                        kind of
                        did look at a map, but I wanted to figure it out myself and there were also a few problems with
                        the map
                        thing: the maps in the station are basically all of rail routes and mostly without street names,
                        and the
                        maps I had were fine but a little limited on information and were harder to figure out in terms
                        of
                        orientation and direction. At some point I figured I should just try an exit and go with it, so
                        I walked
                        back to the exit with views of the biggest church since that seemed like something I had
                        remembered
                        needing to pass by, and headed that way.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        From there I began wandering the city which has got to be one of my new favorite activities.
                        I've got no
                        schedule, nowhere to be, and nothing but time to explore the city and my thoughts.
                        Though I was on my own, I encountered a few tour groups here and there and overheard some of the
                        stories
                        the guides were telling (one was in Spanish so some parts went over my head but I was still able
                        to pick
                        up a decent amount of it).
                        Although I had no formal tour, I was fascinated once again by the architecture and curated a
                        list of
                        things about the city to read up on later.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        I took my time walking around which means I witnessed the passing of a few hours and heard the
                        tolls of
                        the church bells every fifteen minutes. And let me tell you, there were a lot of bells.
                        Each block of the city seemed to have its own church, with its own grand bell tower reaching
                        several
                        stories into the air. It was a little jarring to hear them all going off at once, but hearing
                        the
                        various echoes of them all mixing together was a fun momentary diversion.
                        It got extra interesting when this coincided with passing by a street performer. There were a
                        few
                        scattered about the city, mostly playing gentle accordion or violin music.

                    <p class="info">
                        It was rainy and roughly 40 degrees (Fahrenheit), but I didn't mind at all. I got a little cold,
                        but
                        when it started to bug me I decided to stop into a cafe for some food and warmth.
                        And that's when things got exciting again. In case you haven't heard or have not been keeping
                        track, at
                        this point in my trip I had said a total of four words in German (ja, nein, und, and danke).
                        Since I
                        arrived in Germany it had been on my list to use at least one phrase in German instead of solely
                        relying
                        on English. But every time I had the chance the nerves set in and the plan was always quickly
                        abandoned
                        in favor of looks of confusion, some nodding, pointing, and a few timid English words. But today
                        it
                        finally happened, and I can't quite say why.
                        Maybe it was because of the guy in front of me in line, who said one word and pointed to what he
                        wanted,
                        getting only short German remarks back from the employee behind the counter. Or maybe I was just
                        tired
                        of the disappointment that comes with getting scared at the last minute all the time.
                        Either way, I managed to order in German!
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        I still nodded and pointed since switching over completely with no help or safety net seemed
                        risky and
                        possibly quite confusing for the employee depending on how far off I was, but not a single word
                        of
                        English came out of my mouth which was pretty exciting for me. I must admit, though, that
                        despite not
                        speaking any English during the interaction, I accidentally spoke Spanish several times.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The problem with ordering in German is that sometimes (like this time today) they respond with
                        follow-up
                        questions, also in German. In case you weren't sure, those questions happen to be different from
                        the one
                        phrase I had memorized and used to order, so I was a little stuck. This is where the nodding and
                        pointing came back into play and saved the day.

                    <p class="info">
                        What didn't help anyone was my attempt at still having some sort of verbal answer in addition to
                        that. I
                        was focused enough to realize English was not going to work, but didn't have my act together
                        enough to
                        respond in German (even though I do know how to say yes and no in German, and was assuming these
                        were
                        yes or no questions despite having no actual idea whether they were or not &mdash; that's a
                        separate issue for
                        another day or never who knows). So I had ruled out German for some reason, definitely ruled out
                        English, and somehow settled on Spanish.
                        So there I was responding 'sí' and 'no' to a bunch of questions I still don't know the meaning
                        of. I
                        realized it each time and tried to correct it only when it was too late and the Spanish had
                        already
                        slipped out, but I didn't mind too much as I was still pleased with the initial ordering part
                        happening
                        in German.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        After resting up for a bit, doing a little more work, and feuling up I headed back out into the
                        city.
                        Now is probably a good time to mention that today I had to face and live with my packing
                        choices. Here I
                        was taking the train and wandering around Munich with everything I had brought from America with
                        me. As
                        I was walking (and slipping and tripping) on the wet cobblestone streets I noticed how nice it
                        was to
                        only have one backpack on and not have to worry about anything else. Sure it was pretty heavy
                        (perhaps I
                        still overpacked), but I wasn't concerned with dragging a wheeled suitcase through the uneven
                        streets,
                        and I wasn't worried about forgetting a purse or small bag or anything. It really was quite
                        convenient
                        for absent-mindedly wandering around.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Anyway, back to the story. The rain lightened up as I was slowly heading back to the train
                        station. I
                        didn't get lost on the way back which was only mildly surprising but pretty nice. Once there
                        things
                        started going downhill for a bit when I had trouble getting the ticket thing figured out for the
                        U-Bahn
                        underground train to take to where I was staying. I was tired and confused and the lady at the
                        information desk was rude and not helpful, so the frustration was sinking in. Luckily, a nice
                        old
                        gentleman noticed the trouble I was having and helped me out, making sure I made it all the way
                        to the
                        platform for the train itself before disappearing. At that point the eventfulness of the day was
                        mostly
                        done, and overall I'd say it was a pretty great day.

                        I'll start off by making a general note, which is that I have seen so many dogs. Mostly they
                        have been
                        small and fluffy but not always. Generally, no matter the size of the dog, they have been well
                        behaved
                        and calm. Also, a lot of owners let their dogs wander freely without a leash (they still have
                        the leash
                        they just don't use it), even while weaving through lots of people on crowded streets!
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        I wandered the city for a bit, first stopping by a nice bridge featured in one of the Now You
                        See Me
                        movies that had a bunch of love locks on it. I then made it to Römerburg where I explored the
                        square and
                        had a bratwurst for dinner. There was some promotional event for the museums happening, so it
                        was quite
                        crowded. The surprising part was when an organized performance began in the middle of the
                        square, with
                        the performers dressed in costumes and pale makeup. They didn't speak, but moved according to
                        music
                        mostly reliant on a heavy, steady-beating drum. Torchers lit with fire were swung around, and
                        some of
                        the actors got into a cage made of ropes while the others climbed upon it and moved it in
                        circles.
                        Although I found this somehwat confusing, everyone else present seemed enthusiastic and to enjoy
                        the
                        performance, applauding and cheering loudly for the actors when it finished.

                    <p class="info">
                        By this point it had gotten dark out, so I decided to start walking back. I ended up on a
                        different
                        route from the one I took to get there, so it was interesting to see the city lights at night
                        but also
                        unfamiliar territory. I unknowingly overshot my turn by a block or two, but started to question
                        where I
                        was when it seemed a little off. At this point I turned and walked straight toward the river,
                        knowing I
                        could probably follow that better until I found a landmark I recognized since I knew I couldn't
                        be too
                        far off. As I was approaching the water, I realized I was walking straight into one of two
                        bridges on
                        either side of my hotel, so I had enough of an idea where I was to be fine. Instead of making
                        another
                        (this time correct) turn to get back, I decided to cross the bridge because it seemed nice and
                        why not.
                        As I reached the arched middle, I could see clusters of distant but bright lights and
                        silhouettes of
                        lots of people moving in the dark, so I decided to check out what all the fuss was about.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        As it turns out, I had accidentally stumbled upon the opening night celebrations for Ruderfest,
                        the
                        three day rowing festival in Frankfurt. There were street vendors selling food and of course
                        beer,
                        little tents with carnival games, and a concert by the Roxx Busters who happen to be a rock
                        tribute
                        band. To my surprise and delight, they played several songs I knew from bands like Journey and
                        Queen,
                        and everyone in the crowd was singing along. The other thing was that since so many people
                        smoke, they
                        were all waving real lighters in the air instead of just cell phones. I stayed for a while,
                        listening to
                        the sounds of the concert from up on the nearby bridge and watching boats go by on the river.
                        Eventually
                        I headed back, staying near enough to the river to manage walking the rest of the way without
                        getting
                        lost again.

                    <p class="info">
                        After the semester ended it was a quick turnaround from Chapel Hill to Charlotte to New York on
                        my way
                        out of the country. Just enough time to take a break but not too much, so that I could be
                        organized
                        enough not to panic while still winging most of it.
                        I got to take the airport tram in New York to change terminals from my flight from Charlotte to
                        my
                        flight to Frankfurt, which unbeknownst to me involved going through security again. Before
                        re-entering
                        the airport I wandered for a bit, got a new ticket to reflect the flight with Singapore Airlines
                        instead
                        of JetBlue, and stood in what had to have been the longest security line I've ever been in.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Then it was onto the flight. And wow what a flight! In that eight hour period I ate more (and
                        fancier)
                        food than I'd had in a long time &mdash; they served a snack, dinner, ice cream, breakfast, and
                        beverages
                        throughout the flight. During boarding there was light classical music while flight attendants
                        distributed headphones and socks. Each seat came equipped with a soft blanket and a cushy
                        pillow.
                        Also, this was the biggest plane I had ever seen. It was huge, both from the perspective of
                        looking at
                        it through the airport window and of gazing across the many rows of seats once on board.
                        I read my book (Brave not Perfect, which came recommended by Hailey and mom), and managed to
                        sleep on
                        and off for a total of 3ish hours.

                    <p class="info">
                        In the Frankfurt airport I stumbled around for a bit looking for a SIM card for my phone which I
                        eventually found and charging up my phone before heading out into the city. I walked a few
                        streets in
                        the city, but mostly just to get food so I could go back and eat something before falling
                        immediately
                        asleep.
