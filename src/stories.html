                    <p class="info">
                        I'll need to start this one by rewinding into last night a little bit. When I finally started packing around 11 or 12, I realized I also hadn't yet checked into my flight, so I tried to make that happen. Turns out it was quite a round-about process. I got stuck on one step because apparently you're supposed to input passport information at least 72 hours in advance, and I had definitely missed that mark. So I decided better late than never and entered all my information. Eventually I made it to the last step and clicked the nice check-in button, only to be greeted by an error message saying online check-in is unavailable for the flight. So that felt only slightly like a waste of time, and it added a little to my next-day stress knowing I'd have to wing it at the airport and hope to check-in fine once there. At this point I called it a night, hoping that the little sleep I'd get before waking up to leave in the morning would be enough to carry me through a long day of traveling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        I woke up today after the third or fourth alarm knowing full well it would be my last morning in Copenhagen. I had mostly packed last night, so that wasn't too bad. Since I woke up with one of my later alarms, I wasn't exactly early leaving the house but it's fine. The last thing I had to do before going was return my key in an envelope in the mailbox. I knew I'd need all my stuff with me to do this since I wouldn't be able to get back in once I returned the key. I slowly wiggled my key into the lock and opened the mailbox, put my key in the envelope, sealed said envelope, and placed it back in the mailbox. Now comes the first of many things that gave me trouble today. I couldn't close the mailbox. I couldn't figure out any way to close it without inserting a key to turn the latch to open so that the door could slide shut. Well, I had just sealed my key into an envelope that had to remain in the mailbox, so that wasn't gonna happen. Luckily, Mason let me borrow his key to close the box I had opened with mine. As it turns out this was still too difficult a task for me. Every time I would turn the key to lock it, the latch would get stuck before it could close. At this point I knew I was getting close to actually running late so I rushed back inside and convinced Mason to come out to the mailbox and help me get it closed. With some carefully timed key wiggling, he was able to get it and off I ran to the metro station. I knew our DIS transportation passes weren't quite enough to get us to the airport, so I had been advised to stop at 7-11 to purchase an extension to our passes that would reach enough zones. As it turns out, the closest 7-11 to the metro that I could find wasn't actually in the metro station so didn't sell passes. Once again knowing how my time was ticking, I ran up and down through all the floors of the metro station until I found a kiosk where I just bought a ticket for the airport, and hopped on a crowded subway car with other travelers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        So I rode the metro through a few stops until it reached the airport and proceeded to a self-check-in kiosk. Everything was fine until the machine wouldn't read my passport and said there was an error with my request. With all the minor setbacks I had already endured, and no idea how long security or any of the details involved in it being an international flight would take, I was getting stressed on time. Luckily, the girls at the kiosk next to me had the same issue, were supposed to be on my flight, and were also here for a DIS study abroad, so we made our way to the airline's help counter area together and somehow managed to successfully use the kiosks located there. And then it was onto the next step: security, which was automated for the security entrance of scanning boarding passes and directing different people into different lanes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Now one thing about American security is that they make you do kind of a lot. You've got to take off the jacket and the shoes, remove electronics, remove liquids, step and hold a pose in the scanner for a few seconds, and sometimes walk through another scanner, all for normal checks. On more than one occasion, though, I've been stopped and taken aside for a light pat-down after these steps. This did not happen to me in Copenhagen, but somehow my bag did get selected for a random bag check. This check consisted of the agent barely opening the top zipper of my bag, checking what looked like some strip to detect chemicals or something, and telling me I was good to go. And when going through security I didn't even have to take my shoes or jacket off! I got to keep everything on as I strolled through the scanner, not even stopping inside it or holding any sort of pose for some fancy scan. It was pretty nice. Anyway, once I got through the security checkpoint I had breakfast in the airport before heading to my flight.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        I flew Norwegian Airlines to London for my first leg of the trip. It was a nice flight except that a loud Irish man sitting in front of me kept itching his buzz-cut scalp and getting dandruff everywhere, and he also got a little rambunctious as we waited out the disembarking situation. The situation there was that the airbridge wouldn't deploy, so after sitting on that plane in London for a while waiting, they eventually announced that we'd take the stairs off the back of the plane through the rain into the airport. This turned out to be not too bad, and then I was off on my way to security for coming in internationally. This resembled the previous security check so it also wasn't that bad. With all this I ended up having about a half hour between when I got done with that stuff and when my next flight boarded.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The next flight was also with Norwegian Airlines and it was a big plane. It had three sections of 3-across seats per row, and like the flight to Germany there was had music accompanying a video for the introduction with music during the descent as well. The other cool feature was the way they handled brightness in the windows. Instead of having a shade to pull down they had a button to press that would make the tint on the window darker. And also, as we were descending the overhead cabin walkway lights started cycling through different colors, which reminded me of the rainbow panorama in the ARoS museum.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The flight to Boston got in around 7:30 and my flight out to Charlotte was set to leave at 5am. So I had some time but not too much, just the right amount to stay in the airport all night. It was a good thing I was in no hurry because the customs line took forever. It was so long. I'm talking a line that snakes back and forth for probably the length of a football field. Maybe not that big, but also maybe. It was quite long but also moving at a decent speed. After making it through the line and doing the automatic portion of the questionnaire on the self-service machines, there was more waiting in line in order to do the in-person part. As I made my way to the front of this new line, I noticed there were two officers doing the in-person stuff. One didn't seem to be too worried, mostly just checking the document with the person and maybe asking one or two questions. The other officer was pretty into it. With each person who came to the counter he'd launch into a series of pretty detailed questions, one after the other. There were two people in front of me in line when I saw the strict officer take the couple he was working with off to the side to go through additional questioning and security measures. Now, if you've been following along you know I have a hit-or-miss history when it comes to security. Sometimes it's not bad like most of when I left for Europe. Other times, like the train station in Germany or the random bag check in the Copenhagen airport security process, it's more complicated. I watched as the calm officer called the next person in line up to his podium. They were moving fast through the process, but was it fast enough for them to finish, and the next person to finish, and me to be called all before the stern officer came back and started calling people again?
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Somehow, the answer to that question is yes. I actually made it to the front of the line and got called to go up just before the issue that couple was having got resolved. So I handed over my information, answered one or two questions about where I was coming from, then officially walked back into America! And knowing the long night ahead of me, I walked pretty slowly to pass the time. Eventually I came to hang out in baggage claim for a while before taking a seat in the nice lobby area where other travelers were posted up sleeping for the night. I had planned on sleeping but I was working on stuff and also kind of afraid that with how tired I was, if I fell asleep I wouldn't wake up in time for my next flight. So I stayed up all night. As it turns out, I got pretty invested in the work I was doing and the problems I was trying to figure out, that it didn't occur to me that I should go check in for my next flight until around 3:30. I was mostly okay with this since I had hear security didn't open till 4:00 am anyway. But yeah that's when I got my things together and headed off in search of the ticketing stations. It was then that I realized after looking for any sort of sign or map, that I'd have to change terminals. Fine. The issue was that I had to go from E to B and the airport was situated in a circle kind of. Apparently there would be a bus coming to transfer terminal to terminal, but I kind of realized I was running late by this point and didn't want to risk it with the bus especially since I didn't know where it picked up or whether it even ran so early. So instead I ran. From terminal E to D to C to B. In a big circle around the airport. For 1 mile. With all my stuff (two backpacks). At 4:00 am. It took about 20 minutes, which made me even more tired and also sweaty from it now.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        So after running through tunnels in the airport that felt like the kind of tunnels that make up big stadiums pretty much in a circle, I made it to Terminal B. The next task was finding American Airlines. It took a while to find a sign that said American on it since they were only displayed on little boards hanging from the ceiling. But one finally said American so I followed the arrows on it only to find them pointing toward the exit. I didn't really have time to think about it, so out the exit I went. After crossing the street full of cars and taxis picking people up and dropping them off, I entered another section of the airport that this time had American kiosks! Throwing my stuff down, I quickly entered the number in the kiosk and just as expected my flight popped up on the screen. The unexpected part was the banner that came up on the screen saying the flight was canceled! I was a little confused, but luckily it had options for flights to reschedule myself on, and I got a ticket on a flight leaving around 7. So I headed to security which had a surprisingly long line for 4:30am, then after that I sat at the gate until finally making it onto the plane and out of the Boston airport.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The flight was fine, kind of extra loud which threw people off a little, but it was good. We got the little airplane cookies too which were so good! And for the first time on my return trip I actually fell asleep, and for a whole two hours. After the flight I made it through the airport and downstairs where I found my dad waiting at the bottom for me! We then went to visit my mom at work and my grandma and aunt, and it was so great to see everyone! We then finally headed home to see my sister and my dogs before I unpacked everything then repacked it to move to Chapel Hill for the summer.

                    <p class="info day">Friday, June 7th 2019</p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Well, today was the day of the final which is hard to believe. But yeah it happened. And it was hard. That's to be expected if it's an exam Kris writes, but still. There were lots of true false which I do not like. That question format is one of my least favorite, yet it appeared on the 590 exams and now again on the 426 final. So that was a bad start, then the true false was followed by lots of HTTP. The thing with that is that I just don't think I had a deep enough understanding of HTTP to be able to connect all the dots for it, which is a bummer. Then there was the extra credit. The directions advised using intuition to figure it out. From my time in 590 you all should know I'm not a fan of relying on intuition during an exam — that seems a little risky. So I started tracing the code which got really complicated really fast. I made it through half the problem or so before I had to take a break on the tracing which is when I reluctantly switched over to intuition. I knew it was basically doing recursion, but it didn't really occur to me much while I was taking the exam. Only when Kris pointed it out did it hit me that the code was indeed the Y Combinator. So yeah in case you were wondering what kind of stuff Kris puts on exams, it ends up being questions that make you do things like trace the Y Combinator. But still, it really was pretty cool.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        We took a break after the exam then went back to exhibit our projects. Kris brought us some cinnamon rolls from St. Peder's which was nice and definitely improved the mood after that final. Then we rotated around the room, stopping at every person's computer to check out their websites. It was cool to see some of the different things people did and it was a nice note to end the course on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        I walked around for a bit after class which was nice. Everyone was a mixture of tired from the exam and sad that it was our last day in Copenhagen and our last day together, but we still had one group dinner left to look forward to. A group of us was about to walk over but someone suggested the train, so we headed for the station instead. The issue is that we took the metro instead of the train, and didn't end up saving any time. In fact, we were running a little late but it was fine. The restaurant was in the meat packing part of town and the food was pretty fancy. The highlight was the dessert which was a decadent meringue with some lemon and berry stuff on top. There was also a sort of chocolate brownie fudge thing which was very rich and pretty tasty. It turned out to be a really nice last dinner together.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Kris and Mara walked us all the way home which was really nice. It was a good night together with everyone but a little sad wrapping thimgs up, cleaning, packing, and saying goodbye. Ending a trip like this is hard. I've learned so much from it all and it's been full of really great experiences. I went to a lot of new places, met a lot of new people, and did a lot of new things I never thought I would. I've also had a lot of people who have been there for me in various ways with all this, so now seems like a good time to thank people. I won't get into it too much, but thanks to my family for helping me make this happen, being excited for me, and being there for me from the other side of the world; thanks to Kris for setting this up and making it happen, and to Mara for coming along and spending a few weeks with us; and thanks to my friends in America and Copenhagen for adding so much to this experience. This is starting to feel like some fancy speech so before I get any more into things, for now I'll probably call it a day.

                    <p class="info day">Thursday, June 6th 2019</p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Well today we reviewed for the final which is tomorrow. The review was another group activity, organized such that the course content was divided into four categories, and we'd spend a few minutes in our groups answering conceptual questions about each topic then discussing as a class afterward. This isn't my favorite activity but I am glad we reviewed. We also spent a few minutes going over ways to look into certain subject matters a little more in the future if we ever get curious, which was good to have some direction there.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        After class, it was pretty much straight to studying after the usual amount of procrastinating. Studying was rough. There was a lot of material and I think everyone was feeling the stress. Even though Kris said he didn't want us spending all our time studying, with the class the way it is and the way Kris's exams usually are, studying is exactly how we spent our Thursday.

                    <p class="info day">Wednesday, June 5th 2019</p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Today we learned about cookies which was pretty interesting. It's something you see so often so finally getting a sense of what cookies are and how they work was cool. After class ended early today we headed out to Islands Brygge, a big park along the edge of the canal. Someone brought a speaker and we played music, laying in the grass and soaking up the sun on this warm Copenhagen day. I may have fallen asleep, or if not I came pretty close. I even managed to read a few pages of my book so all in all it was a nice afternoon, even though I may have gotten a little sunburned.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        We got ice cream because why not and because nothing beats a cold ice cream on a warm day spent hanging out by the water. As people headed back home, I decided to take my time partly because it was so nice and partly because the sooner I got back the sooner I'd need to study for the final wihch is coming up, and I'm quite a procrastinator. The nice thing about the canal and the park is that they have areas of the canal alongisde the park dedicated for swimming. I sat on the edge of a dock and put my feet in for a minute. The water wasn't particularly warm, but it was refreshing. I knew I had a long walk back under the bright, warm sun, so I figured I may as well go for it and jump in the canal while I could then dry off on the way home.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Since I was still in the mood to procrastinate, and since it wasn't my first time at this park, I decided to walk home without looking at a map and see how far I could get before getting lost. I took a few turns that weren't exactly wrong, but weren't streets I'd been down before. It all worked out though because I eventually found my way home.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        For the next part maybe I'll start by giving some background information. When you walk through the square about a block away from our classroom, you notice some golden arches on the side of a big building. As it would happen, those arches just happen to mean it's a McDonald's! So, every time we walk over there, such as on the way to and from Tivoli, a little bit of curiosity comes around about whether or not it'll be a cool McDonald's with foreign food or if it'll be one of the ones that only has the same stuff you can get in America. Alright, I think that's enough background to keep going with the story.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        So, we left off when I had just gotten home. I went to my room to put my stuff down and try to convince myself to study, but I ended up talking to Emily and we figured out that neither of us had had dinner yet, and both of us wanted to figure out the scoop with that McDonald's. So that was enough reasoning to convince us to go, and we walked to check out the McDonald's.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Before we made it to the McDonald's we passed a lot of souvenir shops along the way and stopped in a few of them to check some things out. Somehow we both managed to find a few little things for people, even though shopping and deciding what to get people are always hard. We only made a few stops, though, before reaching the McDonald's.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The thing with foreign McDonald's restaurants is that they're so nice. This one was two stories, and you could order and pick up your food on either floor. The other relevant detail is that the only kitchen was on the top floor. So if you ordered your food downstairs, the extra fancy thing was that they would deliver it from the kitchen upstairs to the counter downstairs via a conveyor belt on the ceiling. The bag of food would be clipped into the conveyor belt, then moved along the ceiling before getting lowered through a hole in the floor down into the room below. Another nice thing about this McDonald's was the food. As we had hoped, they had lots of choices you can't get in America, like veggie burgers, pepper fries, or macarons. So of course we tried these new foods, and I've got to say it's a shame America doesn't have them, especially since I feel like Americans would love some of the options they had.

                    <p class="info day">Tuesday, June 4th 2019</p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Today started out as such a nice day. We had class then I went to pick up a few things at the store before coming home for lunch. I made a quesadilla then ran into Anna in the living room, and we decided to spend the afternoon in the Botanical Gardens with Emily. Everything was so green and colorful, and there were little stone paths all over the place, waiting to guide you to some hidden spot full of new plants. With the smell of flowers in the air and lily pads covering the ponds, the gardens brought out a sense of peacefulness, which was visible on the faces of other visitors as they strolled by.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Eventually we had to head back home to get ready for the evening. We would be going to have dinner with a Danish host family at their home, which we were mostly excited but also a little nervous for. The DIS folks split us into groups and sent us on our way. Even though our taxi was late, Natalie, Emily, and I made it to our host’s apartment close to on time, where we were greeted by a woman named Winnie who was probably in her 60s. And so began one of the most awkward dinners I have ever experienced.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Winnie walked us through her apartment to the living room where we’d eat at a nice wood table, telling us a little about herself along the way. She noted how her son married someone who worked for DIS, so she felt obligated to contribute by hosting students for dinner. So it was a good start hearing that the only reason she had us over was because she felt like she had to, not because she was excited to get to know us or anything. Then she commented on her love of dolls as we passed a line of them sitting on a shelf. When we got to the table, Winnie came out with a bowl that had two plain pieces of salmon in it and asked which of us was vegetarian. Seeing as none of us is a vegetarian, we all just stood there confused, not really sure where that was coming from or what was happening. When we finally told her no one was vegetarian, she proceeded to pull up her email and find the message that stated that Natalie was, in fact, a vegetarian but that fish was okay. Unsure of what to do next, we walked to our seats as Natalie clarified that she really wasn’t a vegetarian, though the dish being served had long since been decided upon.

                    <p class="info">
                        So far, we were doing fine. But then she brought out the meal. I’ll ease you into this by starting with the sides. There was a bowl of cold, undercooked rice with corn in it, warm bread (which was by far the highlight of the meal), and a bowl full of bell peppers and tomatoes. Now for the main dish. It’s nearly impossible to think of this without the revolting taste rushing back to me, but here we go. I’ll also preface this by saying the main dish was also served cold, just so you can keep that in mind as you hear what it was. The bottom layer was pieces of salmon. The fish was drenched in some thick sauce that was a very yellow combination of mayonnaise and curry. On top of the sauce were piles and piles of caviar, both red and black. To top it all off, there was a line of shrimp going right down the middle of the dish. And lining the sides of the dish were hard-boiled eggs. If you know me at all then you know I don’t like fish, I don’t like shrimp, and I don’t like eggs. So I wasn’t exactly thrilled. But I ate it anyway, though I didn’t know you’re not supposed to eat the skin of salmon until I saw Natalie eating around it on her piece, but by this point I had already eaten as much of that salmon as I could manage. At this point maybe you’re thinking the same thing I was, which is that maybe this was just a traditional Danish dish. So I asked Winnie about the food and if it had a name, and her response was just that it was her mother’s recipe. Even Natalie and Emily who both like fish in real life had trouble eating that meal.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        While we all sat pushing salmon around on our plates, Winnie described the view from the windows. Specifically, she focused on the fact that you could see the prisons from there. The town we were in to have dinner with this woman just so happened to be the town that held all three of Copenhagen’s prisons, two of which are closed prisons and only one of which is an open prison. This discussion of prison continued, and reached its peak when we heard the story of how three inmates escaped, two of which were caught on a train into Copenhagen and one of which hid out in the apartment complex for a month before also getting caught trying to sneak into Copenhagen.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Another main topic of conversation was politics. Winnie discussed how she is politically active and also general information about campaigning, candidates, and elections in Denmark as today is election day. As it turns out she is part of a right-wing party, though she was careful to mention that she does not let her political activity and opinions come into play when she is watching the children who come to the day care she runs out of her apartment. We talked about a controversial candidate, topics like immigration, and general public participation in politics.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        In addition to prison and politics, we talked about her day care, which led to the story of how she voluntarily got attacked by a police dog named Obama while with the children on a trip to the police station. In the politics discussion, Winnie also mentioned how she wasn’t thrilled that her adult daughter had to move home, but that’s what happened since there was no available housing. As it turns out, Winnie’s daughter was in the apartment the whole time we were there but never made an appearance. As we were clearing plates after dinner we heard Winnie go into another room with a plate of food and tell the person inside they could eat now. By this point we didn’t really want to stay any longer but none of us knew how to bring that up and leave, so we walked back into the living room and stood by our chairs at the table. No one sat down, we just stood there and kept talking there like that for at least a half hour, at which point Winnie asked Natalie if we’d like to sit down to be more comfortable, to which Natalie responded “no.” This did not deter Winnie, who kept telling stories and talking with us again for at least another half hour, with everyone standing around the table still. This also somehow led to a pronunciation lesson, in which Winnie decided I should repeat after her as she said Danish words, including what she considered to be the most difficult <a href="https://youtu.be/8im6irRSp0A?t=5">phrase</a> in the language. For some reason Emily and Natalie were not subject to this exercise, so it was just me fumbling my way through words built with letters and sounds that don’t even exist in English. Needless to say, it didn’t go too well. Eventually, after looking at some plants Winnie was growing and talking more about child care and politics, Natalie had the courage to mention calling a taxi, at which point we started gearing up to finally leave.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        As we made our way to the taxi, Winnie had to take out the garbage, so we all went down to the shed full of garbage cans and had a full discussion about trash. We talked all about the 8 different categories you have to sort garbage into in Denmark, stopping and looking in the bin for each type as it was mentioned. She also explained why it was so hard to open the bags you put waste into and why they switched from paper to plastic bags for organic waste. It was interesting, but when I say I love garbage collection this isn’t exactly the type of garbage collection I’m talking about.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        To recap, we had cold fish for dinner in a town full of prisons with a lady who loves dolls and right-wing political activism and where the four main topics of conversation were prison, politics, child care, and trash.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Once we finally made it out of the trash room and into the taxi we thought we were done for the night, but not quite. The whole ride back, the taxi driver excitedly showed us the 3D map on the screen in the dashboard instead of focusing on driving, so we were swerving a bit and had a few almost-close-calls. He had the radio on, and we were all surprised to hear a song from Drew playing. Drew performed for us (and she sang that same song too) at the opening ceremony that DIS held. It was a weird moment, sitting in the taxi after that long dinner and hearing this song, knowing that’s how we started this whole trip and knowing we were now coming close to finishing it.

                    <p class="info">
                        Today we looked into databases in class, and it was cool to get an overview of what they are and how they work. I was a little reluctant to start using them for the website since I wasn’t sure how much of the work I had already done that would need to be redone in order to incorporate the database, but it turned out to be not too bad and pretty nice to have.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        After class we went to a cafe that was known for its carrot cake. The cake was good but the frosting on top was a little sour and not too sweet, which I didn’t love but it was still a decent piece of cake. After studying for 426 for a while longer I made a stop at home and at Flying Tiger to pick up a few random things before heading to office hours.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        It’s hard to believe we actually had office hours, but it did indeed happen and it was so helpful! After weeks of people begging Kris to hold office hours, he and Mara were nice enough to have us over for some “life/website advice,” so after all this time it was a pretty big deal. Luckily the weather was pleasant enough to bike there without being miserable and it didn’t rain on us. The website advice did come, and I’ve got a few more things to work on now that I have that input which is good. They had candies for us to try too, and there were some good varieties though the black licorice was a little strong. We also went over some questions in preparation for the final (which is coming up a little too soon) so that was helpful. And there was life advice from both Kris and Mara. They put thought into the things they were saying and gave some good advice about living life.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Biking home from office hours at 10:30 when it still wasn’t completely dark out, and when it was still warm too, was relaxing and provided some nice views of the water and cool buildings. Once we got home I started the homework Kris released 10 minutes before office hours started and that I hadn’t begun yet. It was all about connecting the database to the website and I thought it was pretty fun, especially the part about mapping to get dates into a better format. Something about that piece of things made it pretty exciting when it finally worked and everything came together nicely.

                    <p class="info day">Sunday, June 2nd 2019</p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Today I slept in. I think I set an alarm but I can't really remember for sure, because if I did I shut it off and ignored it when it went off. So I slept until I decided on my own terms when to get up. In the morning I had some peanut butter toast made with the pieces of bread I had that weren't moldy yet. I also did some work on the website and some powerpoint review for the final. I then left with people around 1:30 for Tivoli Gardens, which proved to be quite a fun excursion.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The weather was nice but it wasn't too crowded, maybe because it was a Sunday I guess or maybe that's just how it worked out. Anyway, the grounds were clean and landscaped nicely, and lines for the amusement park rides weren't bad. To everyone's surprise (and my own too) I went on a decent number of rollercoasters and rides. Even though I was a little scared for some, I did have fun, especially since there were plenty of kid rides to be done and not just the scary ones that turn you over and upside down a million times. There was even a ride resembling It's A Small World at Disney, only this version depicted several of Hans Christian Andersen's stories. This isn't too surprising since Walt Disney visited Tivoli several times as inspiration for Disneyland.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        We took a mid-afternoon break for ice cream cones, which were delicious. I had brownie ice cream and a scoop of some flavor called Lion which is hard to describe, but it tasted like a combination of caramel and coconut or maybe coffee or toffee, but it wasn't chewy or anything, aside from the chocolate chips in it. The day was warm so the ice cream was a sweet and refreshing treat. After checking out more of the park, we had dinner in the food hall where I had some of the fanciest chicken nuggets I've ever had — the looked like hush puppies and tasted fantastic. Since it takes forever to get dark here, we took our time eating and wandered around the park a little more before all the decorative (and functional) lights turned on. It was so nice seeing everything all lit up so warmly, and the mood was so positive and generally happy with all the people strolling about, admiring the colored lights hanging from every building and tree. We ended the night watching a spectacular light show on one of the ponds that had smoke and fire and fountains in sync with music playing in the background. It was the perfect way to end a long day of good old fun.

                    <p class="info day">Saturday, June 1st 2019</p>
                    <p class="info">
                        I took the train again today! This one was from Copenhagen to Malmö, Sweden and it was short, only about 40 minutes long. They did check our passports on the way to Sweden from Denmark, but not on the way back. In fact, they didn't even check our tickets on the way back. But yeah I went to Sweden today!
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The train was crowded but it had great views of the Øresund strait we crossed to get into Sweden. Once there, we checked out St. Petri Church and walked through the central square before lunch. We stopped to eat at a food truck festival. Lots of families were spread across the park picnicking on their food truck food, and many had small children or babies and dogs. The highlight was a bakery stand that had incredible donughts which was just what I needed to fuel me up for the rest of the day.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        We then walked through Folkets Park, where we found a skateboarding competition going on, a mini golf course, lots of playgrounds, and little restaurant stands. There were also lots of fountains with children playing in them, and unlike in America it isn't unusual for children to be swimming and playing in the water clothing-free.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Our next stop was Slottsträdgården park, which surrounded the moat around the castle. The moat was wide and flanked on either side by tall reeds, from which geese, ducks, and swans would magically appear, followed by their goslings, ducklings, and cygnets. It was peaceful and quiet, with an occasional light breeze. There were paths and benches and bridges crisscrossing everywhere, yet it didn't feel chaotic or crowded. After a while we came upon the Castle Mill windmill, which was quite large but didn't seem out of place. We took a break on the grass in front of the windmill, watching families walking by and the occasional rustling of tree branches in the wind. This spot also had a nice view of the Turning Torso skyscraper off in the distance, which was cool to see all lit up by the sun against a backdrop of dark clouds that simply added color to the scene without dumping buckets of rain, which was nice. Everything was so calm and almost sleepy that walking through the parks and the city felt kind of like a dream, and it took a few reminders to remember that this was in fact real life.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        On our way back to the train station we took a slight detour to see a small lighthouse. It was only a short walk and the sights we saw made it worth it, plus we still made it on time for the train. As it turns out, though, we could've been a little late and things would've been fine as our train was delayed a few times before finally leaving.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        I ended the day by doing a little tiny bit of 426 studying and cooking dinner. I made one of two things I know how to make (pasta and quesadillas). This time I went with pasta, with salt, pepper, cheese, and tomatoes. When I went to the store I also picked up some juice which turned out to be strawberry juice, so it was sweet and seemed to go well with the pasta.

                        We had a full day of class today getting our websites set up on AWS and learning about web form processing. After that, it turned out to be a nice day with pretty good weather, so we walked to the Royal Library and stopped in the Royal Library Garden, which was beautiful. There were bushes with pink and purple flowers everywhere, chairs and benches full of people playing with their children or reading, and a fountain in the middle which provided a soft background noise of water trickling into the large pond below it. The wind was sparse in the garden, and gentle enough to leave the water mostly undisturbed. The reflection of the blue sky and fluffy clouds in the water made it feel as though you were in a painting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        We eventually made it to the library where we did some work on our websites. From there, we took a harbour buss out to Reffen, a street food market with vendors offering different types of food from all over the world out of converted shipping containers. We had some good food and even got to hear the story of Kris and Mara, so it was a fun and hygge-filled evening.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        We then took a bus back which was nice, and I saw a lady carrying her dog in a bag so she could bring it on the bus. On the walk back from the bus I noticed some lights at the bottom of one of the canals we crossed, and it turns out there was some sort of sculpture of people down on the bottom all lit up with red and green lighting underwater, which was kind of creepy.

                        They said it would happen. They all said at some point you'd have a rough day - the study abroad people, Kris, students who have studied abroad before — most people warned about it or at least dropped some hints about an off-day somewhere in the middle of the experience. Well, we're right around the midpoint (which is so hard to believe), and it was the closest I've come to knowing what they meant by "rough day". Nothing in particular was extra bad about it, really it was just another full day of class to start with. We began diving into server-side stuff which was interesting. But the day or maybe even the week in general just felt like a lot and I was kind of tired. After we got home and started doing some work though, things got exciting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Before we get to the exciting part, it's worth noting that it was also a little stressful, and not even for me mostly. Somehow someone got into a mess with git, which isn't hard to do, but is hard to recover from, both for your mental state and for your code. As it turns out I somehow ended up trying to fix the issue they had. Understanding and diagnosing the problem had to happen first, and it ended up being some sort of merge conflict. So now you know the problem, and I'll also mention that even though it's pretty obvious, the exciting part was getting to fix it. Git problems can be quite frustrating and usually stressful since they mean something's not right with keeping track of all your hard work. But somehow the fact that it was someone else's problem made me more calm and confident that we could fix it. There was also the thrill of knowing that this was a chance for me to use and actually apply the knowledge and skills I've built up. Add onto this that we learned git in 590, and the tie-in with that class takes the fun to another level. Morale was generally low, but me realizing I was equipped enough to possibly handle this problem and also tasked with fixing it had me pretty excited. There's just something fun about knowing you've got everything you need to get the job done, along with the fact that it needs to get done, and you can feel yourself chipping away at the problem little by little, inching closer and closer to a solution. You've got all the pieces of the puzzle, all the tools in the toolbox, and now you get to decide how to put it all together. I did fix the issue, and in doing so had one of those moments when you realize how much you've learned. The other thing that felt noticeably nice was banging away on the keyboard trying different things and pausing to appreciate that everything I was deciphering and everything I was trying had meaning to me; it wasn't full of mystery commands or long error messages that sounded foreign to me. Sometimes I forget or don't always realize it, but I really have learned so much.

                        Today was a long day. We got up early to have a morning of design with a professional from DIS.
                        She lectured about her experience and some key elements of design. I almost unintentionally fell
                        asleep several times during the presentation, but I never actually did all the way sleep. I was
                        a little annoyed by the presentation style and how she answered questions but ultimately some
                        interesting points were made. We then visited some fancy furniture design stores which was a
                        fine experience. At some point in the tour we visited a hot dog stand, and normally I'm not a
                        big hot dog person but I decided why not so I got a hot dog with everything on it, and wow it
                        was delicious. I wasn't expecting to like it that much since it's a hot dog after all, but it
                        was really quite tasty. Anyway, that was just a stop along the way between the design stores and
                        the design museum.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        It was at one of these stores that I had an unexpected conversation with Jeanette, the
                        instructor from DIS who was leading this design tour. I was walking around, checking out a
                        collection of pastel-colored office supplies when she approached and asked my thoughts. Design
                        isn't really my thing so I didn't have many thoughts to share, but I gave it a shot and the
                        conversation turned to what I want to do in computer science, which of course I don't know. So
                        yeah so far not the most enlightening conversation. But then it turned to a why computer science
                        discussion, which is one I always enjoy. That's a topic I think about every now and then
                        partially because I'm still a little surprised I'm actually doing computer science. So in
                        answering her questions I had discussed a little about how I got involved in computer science,
                        and she shared her experience learning about coding. This was more my speed than design
                        specifics, though that was interesting too. Anyway, the conversation took a turn into some
                        barriers to computer science. To be more precise, these barriers weren't specific to computer
                        science at all. I'll get to the point now I guess. In the middle of the upstairs section of the
                        Hay design store, Jeanette and I were there discussing how fear, specifically the fear of
                        failure, holds people back so much despite just how necessary failure often is for success.

                        If I'm really going to be honest, this hit kind of close to home for me. The other weird part is
                        that this subject is pretty central to the book I'm in the middle of reading, so that conection
                        was surprising but also somehow seemed fitting. Jeanette told an anecdote about young children
                        learning music, encouraged to add a few notes from their own creativity to the end of the song
                        they were learning. Despite the intention as a small exercise in creativity, the children
                        wouldn't even press one key on the piano out of fear of failing and playing something bad. It's
                        things like this that you don't realize happen so often. These little instances of fear winning
                        out over trying new things or being expressive build up into habits, to the point of not even
                        realizing that's what's happening.

                        The thing with computer science is that it's impossible to do without failing. You pretty much
                        can't write a program or make real progress in code without usually failing a little bit first,
                        and having to try a few different approaches. But kicking the habit of fear is a tough thing to
                        do. Sometimes it hits you that you're in the middle of one of those moments when you let the
                        fear take control, which results in a feeling that's pretty much a mixture of disappointment and
                        frustration. The small sliver of a silver lining to it at this point is that the more this
                        happens, the more that feeling changes. It becomes less disappointment and more determination, a
                        determination to fight back against the fear even if it's uncomfortable to do so and to just go
                        for it anyway.

                        It's not even that easy though, it's not like realizing it somehow solves it and you're good to
                        go. It's not a secret where once you learn it you've unlocked some new level of living.
                        Realizing it just means you're taking on the challenge of undoing 20 years of practicing the
                        habit of living in fear of failure. That's no easy task, which means sometimes it'll be great
                        and you'll catch yourself right before falling into that habit and you'll muster up the courage
                        to overcome it. But sometimes you won't realize you've fallen into the fear again until after
                        the fact. And sometimes, you know it's happening but you just don't have the energy to stand up
                        to it.

                        It's a weird mix of fighting and failing. It's forcing yourself to do things that maybe you'll
                        fail at, and being okay failing. But that in itself is a goal, and failing at that goal results
                        in a weird paradoxical feeling. When you mess up or don't take the risk, it's a bummer when you
                        know you should and still don't. But then that's just a small failure from your goal, which
                        you're supposed to learn to take, right? Failure isn't a major defeat or loss, it's just
                        something that points you in another direction, one that may be better.

                        The other point of my book is not worrying about being perfect. So in the effort to confront and
                        be okay with failure, identifying and facing little tiny things helps when the big things come.
                        Today, a small failure of mine was in coloring a picture. So really a small scale here, but I
                        was sitting in the Danish Design museum at the conclusion of our design tour with a coloring
                        page in front of me. I was coloring it in with the colored pencils the museum had chosen and
                        arranged together so that the colors would match and complement each other. I could've picked a
                        color from another bin, one that wouldn't match with the color palette in front of me. I
                        could've colored outside the lines, literally. But I didn't do either. I stayed with the
                        pre-selected colored pencils, coloring so carefully in the lines that I only finished two out of
                        six little squares on the page. I was a little disappointed that I did indeed realize I could've
                        pushed myself, and not even that much here, but I still didn't. So especially in light of the
                        conversation from earlier I considered this a tiny failure, but in an attempt to be okay with
                        failure I'll be okay not taking every opportunity I get.

                        class. Kris started class by making us move around and do a group work activity where we'd
                        search a topic online then summarize it briefly to the class, and I'm not gonna lie I didn't
                        like the activity. But we did it, and it kicked off today's class about HTTP.

                        After class I took a break and did some work before figuring out what to eat for dinner. I
                        almost had more of my bread for dinner but decided instead to give cooking a shot. I figured I'd
                        start my first time actually cooking by making a quesadilla. I also had tomatoes and a bell
                        pepper, so I threw those in there too since I was really just winging it completely. I didn't
                        get hurt or burn anything down, and in the end it tasted like a real quesadilla so I'd say it
                        worked out.

                        React and once again that wasn't as great as the morning, but felt a little better than
                        yesterday afternoon I guess. After that class I went to the Round Tower which had a surprise art
                        museum in it. The view from the top was nice but it was slightly chilly up there. In the evening
                        we went to a fancy food hall-court thing which had lots of vendors selling different kinds of
                        food. The place was big but nice and the sandwich I had was quite delicious.

                    <p class="info">
                        Today was a really windy day. I'm talking not really walking in a straight line because of the
                        wind (which was nice having the wind to blame for going all over the place instead of just my
                        usual clumsiness). We had class at our "normal" time today, with a lunch break. I did eat lunch
                        outside which was when I first noticed the wind. Before that, though, we had morning class which
                        was interesting as usual. After lunch things ramped up a bit and got crazy. Class involved lots
                        of follow-along code which I didn't feel great following, so it'll take a few more passes
                        through all the code from class before I'm comfortable with it, but hopefully eventually I'll
                        understand some of it. After class I decided I should buckle down and get to work, so I headed
                        over to the Royal Library which is really quite nice and also quite large. After working for a
                        bit I stopped by the trampolines near the water on my way home, then decided to add another
                        detour to go to the grocery store before actually making it back. This time I went to a
                        different Netto though it was probably the same distant from where we live as the normal one. It
                        was roughly the same, with the same issue of no groceries having any sort of English labeling at
                        all, so there was a lot of guessing involved. Once I made it home from the store, I was faced
                        with another set of GRQs to spend the rest of the evening on. I won't mention the debating and
                        confusion that ensued with that assignment since by now you should know that that's just what
                        happens with these GRQs.

                        Today we had the day off (mostly, but that's a detail we'll cover later). I got to sleep in
                        which was nice, and I just took a break for a bit then did the normal Sunday things like tidy up
                        and get ready for the week ahead. Now we'll address the detail mentioned before, which is that
                        even though this was a day off, we were assigned GRQs. Please note this is not a complaint,
                        merely documentation of what happened. So I spent the rest of the day stressfully combing
                        through readings and associated questions, dissecting the wording of it all, trying to find my
                        way through confusing wording and complex concepts. Some of this happened at a nearby library,
                        until we got kicked out when they closed, so then I just continued on working away back at home
                        until the night had fallen and my day off had concluded. So yeah, nice day off.

                        We did not have to get up at 6:00am today! I did wake up around 8 though and I didn't even feel
                        tired! It's possible this has something to do with the fact that I went to bed at 10pm last
                        night, which is incredibly early and really just completely unheard of. Who knew going to sleep
                        at a reasonable hour could be so beneficial. Anyway I wasn't tired which was good since we
                        stopped at a modern art museum and a museum sort of about evolution and Danish history on the
                        way back to Copenhagen. On the ride back I wasn't asleep, contrary to the early morning trip to
                        get to Aarhus, so I was able to do a little work and even read my book. I also got to look out
                        the window for a while, and which brought to mind two observations, first that there really are
                        a lot of wind turbines, and second that there are no billboards along the road which is a nice
                        break from America where you'll see two or three in stacks that rise up as far ahead as you can
                        see.

                        6:00am is too early for people to wake up. No one could possibly be clear-headed and productive
                        so early in the morning, which is just the excuse I think I'll go with for why I ended up in
                        such impractical and painful shoes today. With a meeting time of 6:45am and a tendency to
                        oversleep just a little, I was in a bit of a hurry this morning. I knew the agenda included a
                        trip to the historic Jelling Stones and a talk at Google, which I'd have to look presentable
                        for. Not wanting to deal with changing later and packing more clothes I just went with the
                        business casual from the start of the day.

                    <p class="info">
                        Our stop on the way to Aarhus was to learn some Danish history and see the old Jelling Stones
                        which were a pretty big deal in establishing the country as it would come to be known today. It
                        was cold, rainy, and windy, but the guide did a good job anyway and soon enough we were back on
                        the bus on the way to Aarhus.

                        offering different kinds of food. After that it was a short ride on the bus over to Google where
                        we heard a talk from Dr. Mads Ager, who was instrumental in working on the V8 JavaScript engine.
                        He did a fantastic job, explaining some of the background of V8 and how Google managed to
                        establish a 30-person office in Aarhus, Denmark. It was really cool to hear him talk about
                        concepts I had learned about in school (especially all the things that came up which I was able
                        to recognize from 590). To begin the talk he gave some life advice about taking the time and
                        putting in the effort to find something you really love doing and are interested in, which I
                        thought was a good way to start and good to hear in general as someone still trying to figure
                        out where to go with my life.

                        Dr. Ager was truly excited about everything he talked about, and he knew how to cover complex
                        topics at a level we could understand and discuss in a short period of time. I also appreciated
                        the thought he gave when taking and answering questions we had. He also talked about his current
                        project, something like the Dex compiler used in Android devices, JavaScript engines and how
                        changes in ECMAScript work with Google and others involved like Microsoft or Mozilla, the
                        importance of thorough testing, the practice of code review at Google, and doing work that makes

                        After Google, we checked into the hotel and walked around Aarhus, which was fun, especially for
                        people wearing sensible shoes. Unfortunately, as previously mentioned my shoes were less than
                        sensible and more on the painful side, but I still enjoyed seeing the city. The library had a
                        bunch of playground structures which was an unexpected diversion before going to a fancy dinner.
                        They had chicken sandwiches and french fries and bread all with really good side sauce. The
                        highlight was the ice cream they served, though the apple, lemon, and cinnamon flavors were
                        unusual and quite strong. Aarhus also had a nice rooftop deck in the middle of things that
                        overlooked the city, providing great views of everything.

                        common, and most streets have nice bike lanes which make it less scary even though you’re still
                        often riding alongside cars on your left and pedestrians on your right. There are also no left
                        turns which was good to know before we started our tour. In order to make it to the departure
                        point of the tour we had to ride a few blocks as a group, which was nice preparation for the
                        tour. When we started off Kris took the lead which was good since no one had any idea where to
                        go, but he did start off by making sure we knew that if we got separated from the group then we
                        were on our own to figure it out with Google Maps. Then he took off and we scrambled to keep up.
                        But the tour guide felt it more necessary to make sure everyone was always accounted for which
                        took some pressure off.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The tour guide took us through four neighborhoods with stops along the way to hear about the
                        city and various aspects of life in Copenhagen. I learned lots of things, like how it’s common
                        on a street to see the bike lane wider than the lane for cars and buses, or that secularization
                        has been such a big thing that many churches have been sold and now have other functions or are
                        still churches but don’t advertise their religion.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        We had lunch in a community center that was one of those places that used to be a church. It was
                        easy to tell the building used to be a church, but it was nice to see it so full of people
                        working and hanging out together there in the middle of a Wednesday morning. It wasn’t an
                        intimidating or imposing structure, but rather welcoming and bright. The inside was painted in
                        light pinks and greens and oranges and other colors, and the center was filled with long tables
                        and places to sit. There, we had oksedeller for lunch, which was some sort of chorizo with rice
                        and a tomato sauce, topped with pomegranate and cilantro. It was warm and delicious and quite
                        filling, which was just what we needed to refuel for the bike ride back. All the biking was nice
                        but I’m definitely going to be sore.

                    <p class="info">
                        In the afternoon we had class which was fun. The day pretty heavily resembled a day in COMP590,
                        which I loved. I learned more about JavaScript, language features, support of various features
                        across different browsers, transpilers, and how things like HTML and JavaScript work together
                        which was cool.

                    <p class="info">
                        After class we headed off to a picnic put on by DIS. It was crowded and a little chilly but we
                        got hot dogs and chips and some Danish water and soda, so it was a good free meal and a nice
                        break from 426 before heading back home to work on tonight’s assignment.

                    <p class="info">
                        Today started with a boring and useless welcome ceremony at 8:30am which is a little early for
                        something so unnecessary. The only upsides were that it was in a cool building and they had live
                        music thrown in there to try to keep us awake, though it was only somewhat successful on that
                        front. Next, we stopped in a coffee shop before getting lost on the way to class.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        We were mostly together which helped in trying to figure out where to go, but from the direction
                        we came the classroom was in a building hidden behind two other buildings (though we did
                        eventually find a clearer way to get there). Luckily Kris saw us wandering around all confused
                        from up in the classroom window and came down to lead us there. The room was quite nice, again
                        spacious and bright, though upon first glance I didn't notice too many outlets which may cause
                        trouble but we'll see.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Though we met back at UNC, today still counts as the Copenhagen First Day of Class which is
                        always an exciting
                        day, regardless of what country you're in. I'm not gonna lie I wasn't initially excited about
                        the first part of the lesson which focused on some design concepts to watch out for, like
                        typography. But it was absolutely interesting how so much goes into the text on the screen and
                        how humans read it and the effects of styling things different ways, even though it still felt a
                        little out of reach for what I felt were my skills and with where I was at. Playing around with
                        it later was fun, though. The other nice part of the morning class was learning a Danish word!
                        (for those of you who are curious, the word is tak and it means thank you)
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Then we had a break for lunch (cereal) and started up in the afternoon talking about JavaScript,
                        which was so fun. I learned about lots of interesting things like the symbol type, variable
                        hoisting, and different types of functions. This also made me more excited to get into using
                        JavaScript and soon TypeScript!

                    <p class="info">
                        We had a bit of a break after class before heading to a group dinner at a nice Mediterranean
                        place. There was lots of food, all of which is pretty far from my usual diet. Despite being
                        uncommon for me the food was delicious. I had some potatoes, pita, other colorful vegetable
                        stuff, and a pice of falafel which did indeed taste better than the falafel I had at 3:00am at
                        the last Hack110. It was a great dinner which left me full and ready to do a little more work
                        before calling it a night in preparation for the big bike tour tomorrow.

                    <p class="info">
                        After getting off the night bus in Copenhagen we walked over to Selina's hostel and continued
                        working on 426 for a few hours. Around noon we headed to the airport to check in for DIS! Even
                        though I'd been working on stuff for class for a while now, seeing the DIS people and other
                        students gathered together made study abroad feel much more real. They provided snacks and water
                        for us, gave us some necessary information to make sure we had everything we'd need to get
                        started, then took us (by bus, but nicer and with fewer flies than the one last night) to where
                        we'd be living for the next three weeks. We met with more DIS people and got all settled in, and
                        I was so pleasantly surprised to discover just how nice the building we're staying in is. The
                        common areas are bright and inviting, and the bedrooms are spacious with large windows and
                        comfortable furniture.

                    <p class="info">
                        Though I wanted to procrastinate forever on unpacking all my stuff, there was an orientation
                        meeting at 5 and pizza at 6 to motivate me to finish in a decent amount of time. I was pretty
                        tired but managed to get mostly organized. And then came the snacks and pizza, which I was so
                        excited for. I hadn't had pizza since America but it's one of those things that just always
                        sounds good. Free food is always nice, but add on the fact that I was hungry and the part about
                        it being pizza of all foods, and I was pretty happy when I finally had a warm slice in my hand.
                        I even tried artichoke pizza, and I've got to say the extra toppings on it added some nice
                        flavor and texture to the already delicious pizza.

                    <p class="info">
                        Today of course began with some 426 prep, but after working for a while we headed to see the
                        Berlin Wall. We followed a path along the wall and took in all the murals painted along it as
                        part of the East Side Gallery. We also went to a nice cafe for some fancy Baumkuchen chocolate
                        cake which was quite delicious. After this we headed back to the train station to wait for our
                        night bus to Copenhagen.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The fancy train station had a McDonald's with German food they don't have in America so that was
                        interesting, and they also had an Ampelmann store! The Ampelmann is the cute little green man in
                        the walk symbol for pedestrians throughout streets in Berlin. It has also expanded into quite a
                        brand, selling everything from bath robes to pasta.

                    <p class="info">
                        Eventually we got on the bus around 10:30, and it was nice aside from a fly infestation and WiFi
                        that didn't work. This took us to a ferry around 5:00 am, and we eventually made it to
                        Copenhagen a little before 8:00 am. I slept some on the ride so hopefully that'll help with
                        getting on track with a better sleep schedule in time for the start of class.

                        The day started as they have been recently, with me working on 426. Later on Selina came to
                        Berlin and we made our way through the city, stopping in notable place like Alexanderplatz and
                        the Brandenburg Gate. As we walked through the city we noticed a bunch of bear statues
                        everywhere. As it turns out, these bears are Buddy Bears, which have been the symbol of Berlin
                        since the early 2000s. The bear is part of Berlin's coat of arms, and these bears specifically
                        are meant to promote unity, kindness, tolerance, optimism, and other positive sentiments.

                        I also tried currywurst today, which was basically a fancy hot dog with really thick ketchup and
                        curry. It was a little spicy but not too much, and overall I'd say it was pretty good. We got a
                        little lost coming back when the metro line we needed wasn't running but we eventually made it.

                    <p class="info">
                        This morning when I woke up, I knew I was checking out of my hotel, but I didn't know a thing
                        beyond
                        that. Before I started to pack I decided I'd head to Berlin, Germany. It was a step closer to
                        Copenhagen
                        so why not. So I was able to book a ticket for a train to get there, but that's about it. I
                        checked out
                        fine then hurried off to the train station so I wouldn't miss the train. The tricky thing about
                        taking
                        the train from Prague is that they don't have platform numbers listed on your ticket, so you
                        must go and
                        watch the screens, waiting for them to update with departing trains, times, and platforms. This
                        information is only displayed in full around 20 minutes prior to departure, so you've got to
                        make sure
                        you know where things are so you can get to whichever platform you need to be at in time.

                    <p class="info">
                        The train was quite crowded this time, but the ride was scenic as usual. About halfway through
                        the train
                        ride was when I spent more time trying to figure out my plans. I knew I still didn't have a
                        place to
                        stay in Berlin, so I figured I'd start with that since I was already on my way there. I did find
                        somewhere so there's no need to worry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The Berlin train station was huge. It was bigger than any other I had been to, with somewhere
                        around 5
                        stories. There were about as many restaurants and shops as one would find in a decent sized
                        shopping
                        mall. The cool part was standing in the middle, watching trains go by above you and below you at
                        the
                        same time.

                    <p class="info">
                        From there I got settled into the new city, went for a walk in a nearby park, and ended the day
                        by doing
                        some work for 426. Although I'm not in Copenhagen yet, today was the last day of my solo
                        traveling. I
                        still have one or two days in Germany before I leave for Denmark. I'm not quite sure if it'll be
                        one or
                        two as I haven't planned that far ahead, but we'll see.

                    <p class="info">
                        I am writing to inform you that everything is fine now — but what a long 24 hours it's been!
                        After
                        finally settling in last night I decided to try to tackle some more GRQs. The problem, however,
                        was that
                        my computer and charger decided to team up against me and make it impossible to charge my
                        computer. I'm
                        not sure why they did this but I certainly didn't appreciate it. This has happened to me once
                        before,
                        but I tried everything I could then to fix it, let it rest, and came back the next morning to a
                        happily
                        charging computer. So, I figured I should again try everything I could think of or find to try
                        to fix it
                        as I wasn't fired up about the idea of facing the death of my computer with no apparent means
                        for
                        revival. So I did all the same things as last time, the nervousness increasing as each attempt
                        failed
                        and as the battery slowly ticked lower and lower, making its way all the way to 0%. Tensions
                        were high
                        now, but I could feel my time and hope slipping away the whole time, so although I wasn't
                        surprised when
                        it finally reached 0% as I had known it was coming, there was still the realization that as much
                        as I
                        hated leaving it in such a state, I could do nothing more right then and would have to wait
                        until the
                        next day to try something new.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        So, when I woke up and eventually got over my bad mood enough to do something about the problem
                        I headed
                        to some tech support store as Prague does not have an Apple store. They told me there was an I/O
                        issue
                        in my computer itself and that my charger was broken, so lots of good news. I told them no thank
                        you
                        when they asked to keep it for 2&ndash;3 days to fix it, and tried to just get a new charger but
                        unfortunately
                        they happened to be out of stock. So the closest place I found that sold one was a mall, which
                        was quite
                        fancy and had a KFC and a McDonald's in its food court.

                    <p class="info">
                        The new charger seems to be working fine now, so
                        after I got it I headed into Old Town to check it out and go exploring. I did see some cool
                        sights, and
                        was able to get a glimpse of the Astronomical Clock at the top of the hour. I also tried a
                        Trdelník, which was some sort of cone made of sweet dough filled with whipped cream and
                        strawberries.

                    <summary>From Munich to Music</summary>
                    <p class="info day">Wednesday, May 15th 2019</p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The train ride from Munich to Prague was nice as usual, though this time the scenery consisted
                        of more
                        forests, lakes, and large rock forms. The developed land we passed once crossing into the Czech
                        Repulic
                        was more run-down than what I had seen in Germany and Austria. Once we arrived, I walked around
                        the
                        train station for a bit. It was large and ornate in some areas with enough shops to constitute a
                        shopping mall. My favorite feature of the train station was the piano sitting in the center.
                        Anyone who
                        walked by would slow down as they passed in front of it, with expressions on their faces
                        reflecting the
                        internal debate of whether to spare a minute to play in the crowded space or to continue on
                        their way.
                        The first person I saw to play was a young child. Despite her age she was focused and played
                        well, even
                        with her dad standing over her shoulder. Her playing so calmly in the crowded station must have
                        helped
                        others realize their own bravery; once she finished, other travelers took turns playing a song
                        or two
                        before letting someone else have a chance. This formed an ongoing stream of music, sometimes
                        faint and
                        timid but sometimes with enough force such that the escaping sound drowned out the announcements
                        on the
                        speaker. A school group even passed through with each student taking a few minutes to play.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        It had been months since I last heard a piano, and even longer (if ever) since I had heard full
                        sonatas
                        and concertos, especially coming effortlessly from the fingers of young children. The other
                        thing this
                        demonstrated was just how many people could easily sit down on the spot and play beautiful songs
                        from
                        memory without messing up a note all the while acting like it was nothing. What happened next
                        was quite
                        surprising, and I'm not sure what brought it on, but a few moments after the stream of secret
                        musicians
                        ended, I found myslef walking to the little round stool that sat facing the keys. Before I knew
                        it I had
                        started to play what little I remember, and almost immediately after beginning a feeling of
                        excitement
                        and freedom struck me. And when it did, I realized just how long it had been since I experienced
                        such a
                        thrill. Once so afraid (and maybe in normal circumstances still so afraid), I was sitting there
                        letting
                        the muscle memory carry me through the song as my heart raced. As I have forgotten most of what
                        I
                        learned as a child, I wasn't playing for long, but I won't soon forget the excitement that came
                        along
                        with sitting there realizing what I was doing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Despite some complications leaving the station and settling in at where I was staying, I'd still
                        classify this as a pretty great day. I did something that completely surprised me, and managed
                        to make
                        it through without getting nervous or freaking out even after it hit me what I was doing. It
                        certainly
                        wasn't planned (which isn't surprising given how little planning I ever do), but I'm glad it
                        happened,
                        even if I'm still not quite sure how I did it.

                    <p class="info day">Tuesday, May 14th 2019</p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Not getting on a normal sleep schedule has been a little annoying and very tiring, but it also
                        means
                        another day of not being late which is refreshingly nice compared to my usual routine of being
                        perpetually 5&ndash;10 minutes late to everything back in North Carolina. Anyway, I was walking
                        through the
                        train station this morning, not in a rush but just minding my own business and having a nice
                        time
                        watching people rushing around and stopping for coffee at the various shops. It also wasn't my
                        first day
                        in this train station, so I was relatively confident in where I was going and couldn't have
                        looked
                        nearly as confused or lost as I had the first day. I was walking along as one does, trying to
                        avoid
                        running into people who were late for their trains, when I crossed paths with a group of police
                        officers
                        (is there a name for that? if not then something like flock or gaggle could be good). Not
                        unusual, as I
                        had seen trios of police officers up on the balconies observing everything in my previous visits
                        to the
                        station. I kept walking without running straight into them which was good, still no issues. I
                        had passed
                        them now and heard a conversation pick up among them, in German of course. Unbeknownst to me,
                        however,
                        this conversation was not a mere chat among coworkers, but it was actually a conversation I was
                        supposed
                        to be part of. Of course I had no idea and kept walking which must've been pretty rude, as
                        intentionally
                        ignoring the police and walking away from them is a little more bold than my usual behavior. The
                        noise
                        wasn't getting quieter but starting getting louder, which was annoying so I figured I'd turn to
                        see who
                        they were trying to talk to and go the other direction to get out of the way. Turns out, it was
                        me which
                        was a fun surprise.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        When they realized I was catching on they formed a circle around me so I couldn't try to walk
                        away
                        again, and the one in the middle started speaking rapid-fire German at me. At this point very
                        confused
                        by this unexpected encounter, I wasn't sure what to say but figured the longer I stood still in
                        silence
                        the more suspicious it would be. Eventually I decided to say in English that I don't speak
                        German so
                        couldn't really do anything for them. Although that wasn't enough to get them to leave me alone,
                        it was
                        enough to get the one speaking to switch to the only language I could actually understand. I was
                        relieved, but then he asked for my passport. This doesn't seem like an issue because luckily I
                        had my
                        passport with me, but once again I hesitated, which once again must have been suspicious or at
                        least
                        weird. I only hesitated because apparently some pickpockets work by disguising as police then
                        asking to
                        have your important information and documents before running off with them. So there I was in
                        the middle
                        of the train station surrounded by police officers once again not moving, unsure whether to hand
                        over my
                        identification and unsure of how to know if they really were in fact police officers. Asking
                        seemed
                        bold, but I could think of no other way of knowing and decided to assume based on previous
                        sightings
                        that they were fine, since being uncooperative or sassy with the German police seemed like a bad
                        move.
                        Anyway, I got out my passport and held it open hoping that'd be enough, but alas it wasn't and
                        he
                        grabbed it from my hand. By this point I was quite nervous from the situation, and this
                        nervousness only
                        increased when he paused for quite a while staring at my passport then began asking questions. I
                        was
                        still nervous since that doesn't just go away in the middle of something unexpected like this,
                        but I
                        managed to answer with the truth and tehy seemed to believe me. The last complication was that
                        in
                        flipping through my passport several times he missed the stamp from when I entered the country
                        and grew
                        even more suspicious, but eventually he found it, handed me back the passport without another
                        word, and
                        the group moved on silently. I was still thoroughly confused by what had just happened but saw
                        no other
                        logical step to take besides continuing to walk to my train, so I kept on going. Luckily thanks
                        to the
                        not being late thing I made it on time, but it was a bit of an unplanned detour.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        So even though the day got off to an interesting start, the train ride was enjoyable as ever and
                        eventually we arrived in Salzburg. Aside from being cold and wet from the on-and-off snow and
                        hail that
                        fell down onto the city all afternoon, I had a nice time taking in the sites and the history. On
                        the
                        train ride home it took about 5 minutes of rolling along the tracks for me to fall into a
                        relaxing nap
                        that wouldn't end till we reached Munich again.

                    <summary>A Bavarian Nice Time</summary>
                    <p class="info day">Monday, May 13th 2019</p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Today I actually had a set schedule, which started with going to the U-Bahn across from where I
                        was
                        staying and figuring out a way to get back to the train station. This went much more smoothly
                        than my
                        U-Bahn experience yesterday, so it was nice getting off on the right foot today. I got to the
                        station a
                        little early and took a minute to people-watch as I got my thoughts together. It wasn't too
                        crowded
                        today, so the Munich Hbf felt less overwhelming and it became easier to get the hang of where I
                        was and
                        what I needed to do. The theme for the station was flowers. Large flowers made of brightly
                        colored
                        fabric and string hung from the ceiling, swaying gently every time a bird made its way into the
                        station
                        and flew around. Little flower stickers lined the glass walls of the balconies where people
                        would go for
                        a break from the hustle and bustle on the platforms below. Sitting on a bench on one of these
                        balconies
                        while waiting for my train I could feel the intimidation of the sprawling train station creeping
                        away as
                        a new excitement for the adventure ahead took its place.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The train ride was again peaceful and picturesque, but there were decidedly more animals passing
                        by. We
                        did have to change trains once, but the closer we got to the mountains the more common it became
                        to see
                        dairy farms with cows and other animals grazing in the pastures that ran along the hills. In
                        addition to
                        cows, deer were also common. Because of how cheap milk is in Germany many farmers left that
                        industry and
                        decided instead to raise deer. I also learned that those little huts I kept seeing clustered in
                        a big
                        garden were actually for rent. People living in city apartments could become a member of one of
                        those
                        communities and use one of those plots as a yard and place to grow a garden.

                        After the second train, we had to take a bus. The issue was that the bus was not there and no
                        one could
                        get a hold of the driver so we waited for it outside an Aldi's for about a half hour. Then, once
                        it came
                        we rode through the countryside toward the Alps until we reached the castle. It was a mile hike
                        up into
                        the mountains to reach the castle but it came with great information about the history of the
                        castle and
                        incredible views. The hike itself was pleasant and scenic, and it involved crossing over tiny
                        brooks and
                        passing little patches of snow. Before entering the castle we went up to the bride above it to
                        take in
                        the scenery. The views were indeed spectacular, but what was not spectacular was how the boards
                        all
                        moved and sagged each time anyone took a step, especially considering the height and that there
                        didn't
                        seem to be a limit to how many people were crammed on the bridge. Inside the castle, everything
                        was
                        ornately decorated and epitomized the regal splendor and intricate detail associated with a true
                        fairytale castle. Learning the backstory of its designer King Ludwig added some perspective and
                        provided
                        insight into the region's history. On the way back from the castle we stopped for donut holes
                        from a
                        local vendor. They were made with something in between cream cheese and greek yogurt and they
                        were
                        delicious, partly because they were so warm and I hadn't eaten lunch yet so I was hungry in
                        addition to
                        being cold. The ride back to Munich was peaceful, so much so that I actually did fall aslepp
                        this time.

                    <p class="info day">Sunday, May 12th 2019</p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The day began before 7am which I'd normally complain about for being too early, but I gladly
                        made an
                        exception for today.
                        The excitement of getting to take a 3 hour train ride overrode all my tiredness and crankiness,
                        especially when I got breakfast and decided to go a little crazy and have a latte macchiato
                        (fancy
                        coffee of some mystery variety) along with it.
                        I then made my way to the Frankfurt Main train station, which was exactly how I had pictured a
                        grand
                        station to be, only more exciting.
                        It was still relatively early on a Sunday so it wasn't too crowded, which I was glad about
                        considering
                        I'd never navigated taking the train before.
                        The entrance was magnificent &mdash; it was large and imposing, but not enough to be
                        intimidating, just enough
                        to make you eager to walk the 20 more steps to get inside and see what it held inside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        When I walked in I couldn't help but gasp. There were signs and platforms everywhere. People
                        were
                        rushing about, all seemingly knowing exactly where to go.
                        It took me a minute to take in all the splendor, then another to figure out where I was and
                        where I
                        needed to be.
                        Walking around the station was one of those times when I realized I was on a real life
                        adventure, and I
                        could make it whatever I wanted.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        There was such a mix of people, from adults with a briefcase to young families with children
                        dressed in
                        colorful coats to tourists bogged down with luggage, all on their way somewhere new.
                        I eventually left the bustling station and boarded the train from Frankfurt to Munich, and I've
                        got to
                        say I loved traveling by train! The views were spectacular and the ride was a nice relaxing time
                        to get
                        some work done.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        When I first got on the ICE 1125 I immediately scanned for open places to sit and managed to
                        snag a
                        window seat (my favorite no matter the type of transportation).
                        I did some 426 prep, but repeatedly found myself caught in a trance-like stare out the window,
                        captivated by the rolling countryside and small, cozy towns passing by.
                        No matter the size of the village, there was always a steeple of some sort sticking up above the
                        red
                        rooftops, and most of these towns were bordered on the side by a gently flowing stream.
                        Every once in a while a cluster of windmills or solar panels would float by, exemplifying the
                        country's
                        commitment to the environment and renewable resources.
                        I saw a few horses grazing about, and what appeared to be deer-like animals in the far edges of
                        some of
                        the landscapes. Mostly, though, there were rectangular fields of brown, yellow, or green.
                        When the sun found one of the yellow canola plots, the entire landscape seemed to glow. And when
                        the sun
                        got tangled in the trees on the hills, it cast a sleepy, muted light that lingered into the next
                        scene.
                        With such spectacular scenery, it's a wonder I got any work done at all.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The train made a few stops on the way to Munich but I didn't have to get off or move or switch
                        trains
                        which was nice. After each stop, a woman would walk by selling 'kaffee oder cappuccinos' to
                        passengers
                        for a few euros.
                        I had so recently had breakfast that I didn't buy any train coffee, but it's a good thing I had
                        that
                        coffee this morning or else the gentle rocking of the train, the soft murmur of conversations in
                        German
                        happening all around me, and the mesmerizing countryside passing by could've easily lured me
                        into a
                        peaceful nap.

                    <p class="info">
                        Once in Munich I got lost in the train station trying to find my way out. Compared to the
                        Frankfurt
                        station, the Munich Hbf was less picturesque but larger and more crowded, with more
                        people-watching to
                        be done.
                        There was construction going on so maybe that's why I had trouble finding the main way out, but
                        the
                        other factor was that there didn't seem to be any grand entrance/exit like there was in
                        Frankfurt. I
                        tried a few exits but didn't find the streets or landmarks I was searching for, and ended up
                        going out
                        and coming back in more than a few times trying to figure it out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        You may be asking yourself at this point why I didn't just look at a map, to which my response
                        is good
                        question but please keep the questions till the end so I can finish telling the story. Anyway, I
                        kind of
                        did look at a map, but I wanted to figure it out myself and there were also a few problems with
                        the map
                        thing: the maps in the station are basically all of rail routes and mostly without street names,
                        and the
                        maps I had were fine but a little limited on information and were harder to figure out in terms
                        of
                        orientation and direction. At some point I figured I should just try an exit and go with it, so
                        I walked
                        back to the exit with views of the biggest church since that seemed like something I had
                        remembered
                        needing to pass by, and headed that way.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        From there I began wandering the city which has got to be one of my new favorite activities.
                        I've got no
                        schedule, nowhere to be, and nothing but time to explore the city and my thoughts.
                        Though I was on my own, I encountered a few tour groups here and there and overheard some of the
                        stories
                        the guides were telling (one was in Spanish so some parts went over my head but I was still able
                        to pick
                        up a decent amount of it).
                        Although I had no formal tour, I was fascinated once again by the architecture and curated a
                        list of
                        things about the city to read up on later.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        I took my time walking around which means I witnessed the passing of a few hours and heard the
                        tolls of
                        the church bells every fifteen minutes. And let me tell you, there were a lot of bells.
                        Each block of the city seemed to have its own church, with its own grand bell tower reaching
                        several
                        stories into the air. It was a little jarring to hear them all going off at once, but hearing
                        the
                        various echoes of them all mixing together was a fun momentary diversion.
                        It got extra interesting when this coincided with passing by a street performer. There were a
                        few
                        scattered about the city, mostly playing gentle accordion or violin music.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        It was rainy and roughly 40 degrees (Fahrenheit), but I didn't mind at all. I got a little cold,
                        but
                        when it started to bug me I decided to stop into a cafe for some food and warmth.
                        And that's when things got exciting again. In case you haven't heard or have not been keeping
                        track, at
                        this point in my trip I had said a total of four words in German (ja, nein, und, and danke).
                        Since I
                        arrived in Germany it had been on my list to use at least one phrase in German instead of solely
                        relying
                        on English. But every time I had the chance the nerves set in and the plan was always quickly
                        abandoned
                        in favor of looks of confusion, some nodding, pointing, and a few timid English words. But today
                        it
                        finally happened, and I can't quite say why.
                        Maybe it was because of the guy in front of me in line, who said one word and pointed to what he
                        wanted,
                        getting only short German remarks back from the employee behind the counter. Or maybe I was just
                        tired
                        of the disappointment that comes with getting scared at the last minute all the time.
                        Either way, I managed to order in German!
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        I still nodded and pointed since switching over completely with no help or safety net seemed
                        risky and
                        possibly quite confusing for the employee depending on how far off I was, but not a single word
                        of
                        English came out of my mouth which was pretty exciting for me. I must admit, though, that
                        despite not
                        speaking any English during the interaction, I accidentally spoke Spanish several times.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        The problem with ordering in German is that sometimes (like this time today) they respond with
                        follow-up
                        questions, also in German. In case you weren't sure, those questions happen to be different from
                        the one
                        phrase I had memorized and used to order, so I was a little stuck. This is where the nodding and
                        pointing came back into play and saved the day.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        What didn't help anyone was my attempt at still having some sort of verbal answer in addition to
                        that. I
                        was focused enough to realize English was not going to work, but didn't have my act together
                        enough to
                        respond in German (even though I do know how to say yes and no in German, and was assuming these
                        were
                        yes or no questions despite having no actual idea whether they were or not &mdash; that's a
                        separate issue for
                        another day or never who knows). So I had ruled out German for some reason, definitely ruled out
                        English, and somehow settled on Spanish.
                        So there I was responding 'sí' and 'no' to a bunch of questions I still don't know the meaning
                        of. I
                        realized it each time and tried to correct it only when it was too late and the Spanish had
                        already
                        slipped out, but I didn't mind too much as I was still pleased with the initial ordering part
                        happening
                        in German.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        After resting up for a bit, doing a little more work, and feuling up I headed back out into the
                        city.
                        Now is probably a good time to mention that today I had to face and live with my packing
                        choices. Here I
                        was taking the train and wandering around Munich with everything I had brought from America with
                        me. As
                        I was walking (and slipping and tripping) on the wet cobblestone streets I noticed how nice it
                        was to
                        only have one backpack on and not have to worry about anything else. Sure it was pretty heavy
                        (perhaps I
                        still overpacked), but I wasn't concerned with dragging a wheeled suitcase through the uneven
                        streets,
                        and I wasn't worried about forgetting a purse or small bag or anything. It really was quite
                        convenient
                        for absent-mindedly wandering around.

                        Anyway, back to the story. The rain lightened up as I was slowly heading back to the train
                        station. I
                        didn't get lost on the way back which was only mildly surprising but pretty nice. Once there
                        things
                        started going downhill for a bit when I had trouble getting the ticket thing figured out for the
                        U-Bahn
                        underground train to take to where I was staying. I was tired and confused and the lady at the
                        information desk was rude and not helpful, so the frustration was sinking in. Luckily, a nice
                        old
                        gentleman noticed the trouble I was having and helped me out, making sure I made it all the way
                        to the
                        platform for the train itself before disappearing. At that point the eventfulness of the day was
                        mostly
                        done, and overall I'd say it was a pretty great day.

                    <p class="info">
                        I'll start off by making a general note, which is that I have seen so many dogs. Mostly they
                        have been
                        small and fluffy but not always. Generally, no matter the size of the dog, they have been well
                        behaved
                        and calm. Also, a lot of owners let their dogs wander freely without a leash (they still have
                        the leash
                        they just don't use it), even while weaving through lots of people on crowded streets!
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        I wandered the city for a bit, first stopping by a nice bridge featured in one of the Now You
                        See Me
                        movies that had a bunch of love locks on it. I then made it to Römerburg where I explored the
                        square and
                        had a bratwurst for dinner. There was some promotional event for the museums happening, so it
                        was quite
                        crowded. The surprising part was when an organized performance began in the middle of the
                        square, with
                        the performers dressed in costumes and pale makeup. They didn't speak, but moved according to
                        music
                        mostly reliant on a heavy, steady-beating drum. Torchers lit with fire were swung around, and
                        some of
                        the actors got into a cage made of ropes while the others climbed upon it and moved it in
                        circles.
                        Although I found this somehwat confusing, everyone else present seemed enthusiastic and to enjoy
                        the
                        performance, applauding and cheering loudly for the actors when it finished.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        By this point it had gotten dark out, so I decided to start walking back. I ended up on a
                        different
                        route from the one I took to get there, so it was interesting to see the city lights at night
                        but also
                        unfamiliar territory. I unknowingly overshot my turn by a block or two, but started to question
                        where I
                        was when it seemed a little off. At this point I turned and walked straight toward the river,
                        knowing I
                        could probably follow that better until I found a landmark I recognized since I knew I couldn't
                        be too
                        far off. As I was approaching the water, I realized I was walking straight into one of two
                        bridges on
                        either side of my hotel, so I had enough of an idea where I was to be fine. Instead of making
                        another
                        (this time correct) turn to get back, I decided to cross the bridge because it seemed nice and
                        why not.
                        As I reached the arched middle, I could see clusters of distant but bright lights and
                        silhouettes of
                        lots of people moving in the dark, so I decided to check out what all the fuss was about.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        As it turns out, I had accidentally stumbled upon the opening night celebrations for Ruderfest,
                        the
                        three day rowing festival in Frankfurt. There were street vendors selling food and of course
                        beer,
                        little tents with carnival games, and a concert by the Roxx Busters who happen to be a rock
                        tribute
                        band. To my surprise and delight, they played several songs I knew from bands like Journey and
                        Queen,
                        and everyone in the crowd was singing along. The other thing was that since so many people
                        smoke, they
                        were all waving real lighters in the air instead of just cell phones. I stayed for a while,
                        listening to
                        the sounds of the concert from up on the nearby bridge and watching boats go by on the river.
                        Eventually
                        I headed back, staying near enough to the river to manage walking the rest of the way without
                        getting
                        lost again.

                    <p class="info day">Friday, May 10th 2019</p>
                    <p class="info">
                        After the semester ended it was a quick turnaround from Chapel Hill to Charlotte to New York on
                        my way
                        out of the country. Just enough time to take a break but not too much, so that I could be
                        organized
                        enough not to panic while still winging most of it.
                        I got to take the airport tram in New York to change terminals from my flight from Charlotte to
                        my
                        flight to Frankfurt, which unbeknownst to me involved going through security again. Before
                        re-entering
                        the airport I wandered for a bit, got a new ticket to reflect the flight with Singapore Airlines
                        instead
                        of JetBlue, and stood in what had to have been the longest security line I've ever been in.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        Then it was onto the flight. And wow what a flight! In that eight hour period I ate more (and
                        fancier)
                        food than I'd had in a long time &mdash; they served a snack, dinner, ice cream, breakfast, and
                        beverages
                        throughout the flight. During boarding there was light classical music while flight attendants
                        distributed headphones and socks. Each seat came equipped with a soft blanket and a cushy
                        pillow.
                        Also, this was the biggest plane I had ever seen. It was huge, both from the perspective of
                        looking at
                        it through the airport window and of gazing across the many rows of seats once on board.
                        I read my book (Brave not Perfect, which came recommended by Hailey and mom), and managed to
                        sleep on
                        and off for a total of 3ish hours.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                        In the Frankfurt airport I stumbled around for a bit looking for a SIM card for my phone which I
                        eventually found and charging up my phone before heading out into the city. I walked a few
                        streets in
                        the city, but mostly just to get food so I could go back and eat something before falling
                        immediately
                        asleep.
